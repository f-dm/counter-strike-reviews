10,Counter-Strike,"This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games. It's harder though.",1,1

10,Counter-Strike,"Counter-Strike: Ok, after 9 years of unlimited fun with friends, I have finally quit counter strike. Counter strike, in all of its versions, its just a great FPS game that anyone can enjoy it. Its a great game and all, you just cant stop playing it, you can just sit and play with your friends for days with out stoping. The huge weaoponary option you can choose and the smooth and sound of the game, its just f*cking addicting. With this games I've met so many different people and unique friends. This game is literally G(OLD). To all the young players who are looking for a good cheep and fun game to play with their friends, I highlly recommend on this. I've got (with steam record) 2,484hrs record in counter strike IN TOTTAL,,, and who knows how many more hrs in a non official steam version of this game.... Great Game. GG WP.

10,Counter-Strike,"CS is one of the greatest and undermined games in history. It is, in my opinion, the best  game to ever have a crosshair. It is not a contact sport, so for the girly girls, it is an activity to indulge in.  It starts off with a team trying to kill another team.   I started playing cs when I noticed jacking off isn't the only activity to do on a computer. I started inviting a lot of friends out and getting drinks, as well as a boom box, to spend a nice summer day in the living room playing this wonderful game. I wanted to play every chance that i could. On my road of cs adventures, I encountered a couple of problems; those being that nobody was as fervent as I was about playing, and that when we did play, nobody was good enough, so it wasn't a lot of fun.  Then I discovered that I could sign up for a class with dboorn. I was overly excited, and signed up, but with skepticism at how the class was going to be. Sure enough, I was proven wrong. We started off by practicing a little bit. Then we split off into teams and started playing almost everyday of class. I made some friends, and played with people who had built up their skill gradually over the period of the course.  When I play counterstrike, the whole world disappears. Only I, the mouse, and my teammates remain. We are united in a common goal. We strive collectively towards an end we all desire. Each player has a spot to hold. They stand ready and waiting, eager for their chance to aid the team in what they hope will be a forthcoming victory. Thus, CS celebrates the unity of man, the indomitable spirit in all of us that pushes us and drives us towards excellence. When I play CS, I play until my veins pump battery acid, and then I play some more.  CS is unique among the games because it teaches all of us that no matter where we are in life, there is a role for us to play, and we can help our fellow man by fulfilling that role, and thereby our destiny. What destiny might you ask? I spoke before of unity. And it is that unity that brings us all together like one big loving family. That is the nature of counter-strike; the many working as one. One machine made of well oiled cogs and wheels, moving in unison, happy to play their part in the production of something greater than themselves. Not that these small metal objects are actually animate, I'm of course speaking only metaphorically.  Over the course of the years, I have increased in skill, but I have learned a greater lesson than how to be a better cs player. I have learned how to cooperate with a team to accomplish a goal that we all share. Even if that team is less than ideal. I have realized that cs is about more than just one's athletic ability. Instead, there is a deeper meaning behind the colt, the AK, the AWP, the deagle, the sands under my feet (in d2 or inferno). And more importantly, the teammates at my side. I love them. It is the human element of cs that gives cs its greatness.  In conclusion, I love cs. I love to win. I love pushing myself to my physical limits. It's that feeling that first drove me to the computer. For every second that I am not playing cs, there is only an unquenchable thirst to play. A thirst that grows as every minute passes by when I am outside, sitting at the television, or playing sports. I had an extraordinary time playing this game, and I will return to look at the future students of this game to see that bright eager look on their faces to remind me of how I used to feel. This review may be over, this game may be dead, but I will never stop playing couner-strike (1.6).",1,1

10,Counter-Strike,"  Update to my review with some shameless advertising 05/10/2016:   Hey readers. I am now hosting a server on CS 1.6 where you can play and enjoy the fun experiences I did back in the day.   Map rotations vary from Vehicle, Aim, Surf, Knife, Defusal, and Hostage maps! IP Address: 173.199.73.78:27025     Review 21/10/2014:   I've played this game since I was around 6 years old back in 2002 and it still makes me laugh and have fun whenever I launch it to this very day. Over 12 years of endless entertainment. No other game on this planet has given me more entertainment and enjoyment than Counter-Strike 1.6 has and I doubt no game ever will.  Reason i've only got 38 hours here is because I no longer use the account I originally played cs 1.6 on.   func_vehicle is what makes this Counter Strike game the best out of all the others in the franchise.  Find a server that has car maps or maps with func_vehicle entities and you will have endless fun running over teammates and enemies in all kinds of hilarious and goofy vehicles not giving a care in the world.  You can drive a fork with a meatball on the end of it. Do i need to say more?  Mods on this game are amazing too. There is a mod where you can catch pokemon, level them up, train them and use their skills. Call of Duty mod that is suprisingly better than cod its self, Warcraft mods, zombie mods, basebuilder and so on...  There is even a map for the jailbreak gamemode that has driveable snowmobiles.   1337/10  Leet crew 5 lyf  Kicks csgo's ♥♥♥ by a mile. I forgot how good wallbanging is in this game.  P.S - CS 1.6 is the only Counter Strike game where you can headshot with a knife or buy Riot Shields. Enjoy!  Oh yeah, you don't have to pay to use sprays in this game either.",1,1

I was very young and i was playing with my friends LAN matches sometimes for fun sometimes with bets the loser treats refreshments. xD This game its the reason that i maked my mum to buy me a PC to playing this game at my home. With the time i learn how to modding on CS 1.6 servers,plugins and more stuffs about PC. After this i learn how to aim on the enemy head, how to fire inside the walls, how to hear someone with his steps and HOW TO FIGHT!!! I have played many FPS(First Person Shooter) Games that they called me hacker of my fast killing. I had so fyckin good and bad moments on that game that i will not forget never. For others its only a game for me it was MY LIFE! This wasnt a review but a little story.  SO COUNTER-STRIKE FTW ♥♥♥♥♥♥ES!!",1,1
10,Counter-Strike," After 14 years of existence, this legendary game is still in the Steam top 10 most played multiplayers in the world .   While earning tons of money based on Counter-Strike sales, Valve shows its appreciation to the players that bought the game by still not maintaining it and treating it like it doesn't even exist. Even more, starting with February 2013, Valve has released a couple of minor updates for Counter-Strike which intentionally created problems for the game(suddenly stopping afterwards) so that the players would be forced to migrate to and buy CS:GO(which currently has and most probably will keep having major problems like fps drops and hit misdetection - problem present on all Source engine based multiplayers since 2004).  Congratulations, Valve .    Counting the players that migrated to or play the non-Steam version of Counter-Strike, the game still easily classifies itself even today in the top 5 most played multiplayers in the world .",1,0

10,Counter-Strike,"'Lock and Load.' 'Go go go!' 'Fire in the hole!' 'The bomb has been planted.' 'Counter-terrorists/terrorists Win.'  It is uncountable just how many times have these few sentences echoed in cybercafés across the world. For many, days were spent in front of the computer screen, manipulating the WASD keys with left hand and whirling the mouse with the right one. People yell and frown, they cheer and jeer as they team up their cyber-persona and pit them against another team. It doesn’t matter who won, who lost, who managed to kill to most of their opponents and who died the most, as everything will be scrambled up and reset when a new match begins. What is important is that, for those who are a part of the team, this computer game is their reality. These personas within the computer screen are their true identities. This is counter-strike.   Originally a modification (mod in short) made for Valve’s critically acclaimed Half-Life, Counter-Strike has gained much prominence since its initial launch. It is one of the first and definitely one of the most critically acclaimed multi-player computer games of all times. It is also the game used for many professional electronic sports competitions, such as ESEA League. Of course, this does not put Counter-Strike as a “professional only” game, as it has been enjoyed by many since its launch.  Getting started with Counter-strike is simple. You start off in one of the two teams: Counter-Terrorists or Terrorists. Before the round begins, you will have to purchase your own gun from the market, namely the famous AK47, M4A1, Desert Eagle, MP5, AWP and many more. Do not ask me why the counter-terrorists (namely the police) have to buy their own gun, and that they will have to go out with their lousy default colt pistols. Perhaps the government had some budget cuts and the SWATs have to buy their own guns. No one knows, but at least this will balance up the game. Also, you can equipment such as Highly-Explosive grenades, Flash-bangs (not recommend for beginners), smoke grenades, helmets and kevlars. You can also grab a defuse kit if you are playing on the side of the counter-terrorist, but normally we will steal that from dead teammates. Oh and you will be given a knife for free. Don’t worry about it, as most likely you use it to run instead of anything else.  The gameplay is fairly straightforward as well. There are quite a few number of game mods. The most frequently played ones are the Bomb Defusal maps, such as the all-time famous de_dust, the Hostage Rescue maps such as cs_assault, the VIP Escorting maps and the Kill Them All maps, such as the custom fy_iceworld and awp_map. Like all multi-player First Person Shooters, you will need good coordination and communication with your teammates if you want to win. Don’t worry about it though, because if you are new, just stick around and listen to what others have got to say. Just remember, you are not John Rambo, you only have 100 HP, and a stray bullet from a sniper rifle (AWP) will deal more damage than that.  As time press on, the mechanism of Counter-Strike became outdate. Of course, the legacy of Counter-Strike continues through its successors such as Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, Counter-Strike: Source, Counter-Strike Online (Asia only) and, the newest of all, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Throughout the years, Counter-Strike has evolved to become what it is today while its legend remains. Together with Half-Life and (maybe) Team Fortress Classic, Counter-Strike has not only helped Valve to thrive as a gaming company, but also defined what First Person Shooter should be.",1,0

10,Counter-Strike,"First starting off as a cute, little mod based on the GoldSrc engine, a heavily modified Quake engine, Counter-Strike's legacy continues to strife for a decade and a half over. Initially developed and released on top of a Half-Life modification, with the inspiration from the developer's strong theme and intriguement for military warfare and terrorism, the mod's success was immediately a marvel to behold; selling over 25 million units as a whole in the Counter-Strike franchise.  The maps and various scenarios set around the globe, players assume the roles of soldiers on two teams, counter-terrorists and terrorists. Both with a task, depending differently on the mission. Bomb scenarios, the terrorist team must plant a bomb, in a secured bomb location, while the counter-terrorists must fight back and ultimately defuse the bomb, if it may have been planted. Hostage scenarios is where the counter-terrorists must rescue a group of hostages being held by the terrorists. With both these modes, it has become a traditional campaign over time in different sequels.  The player, depending on what team they have been assigned to, can change their class into eight different character models, as well as buying weaponry and equipment, such as armour and grenades to help against the opposing team. As the round is about to begin, you're left in ''Freeze time'' that allows you to buy things with the money you earned by killing opponents the rounds before. This of course, gives players the time needed to choose wisely on what many strategies they will execute and whether it will be successful compared to your opponents.   This game is also highly customizable on the player's end.The game gives the options allowing for the user to either install or create their own custom skins, spray graphics, sprites, sound effects and HUDS that can be used in-game. I forgot to mention that modding is possibly one the biggest things that makes Counter-Strike such a versatile game to begin with.  I don't have much to complain about this game, other than it's become one of the biggest targets of hacking and cheaters, since its release. Aimbots, that auto-target other players while the player should naturally aim and shoot is just on of the many cheatings that players have executed. Wallhacks, that allows the player to see through walls through work by displaying objects that have translucent textures and can easily see targets through them, while the opposing team has no idea from their own perspective. To me, the cheating in this game is now more to do with experimenting than it is to do with cheating overall.   There's a different meaning when it comes to something that is outdated and old-school. Old-school is for nostalgic value, something that will guarantee to put a smile back on your face from all these past memories you've experienced and this is what the first title of Counter-Strike engulfs. Outdated, being something you don't particularly want to go back to, while there is the famous remake, Counter-Strike: Source, that runs on the more powerful and overly-recycled Source engine, allowing for better graphic and communication capabilities. Nevertheless, if you're looking for original flare that is burning in the Counter-Strike series, this game is definitely for you.  And to think, all of this success for the Counter-Strike series began as small little mod. Proof on how something so little, can create something so big. Recommended.",1,1
10,Counter-Strike,This game is unlike the other counter strike games. This game requires a different type of skill. You have to become used to the recoil each weapon has.

And cos this game is so popular that thousands of servers host this game online, that some PC criminals tend to take advantage on players like using hacking or server addon hacking materials. So you maybe best to stay clear of weird or dodgy servers with extreme adult material and Steam cannot unban victims who got hijacked and VAC banned, so please be careful!  But if you are old and wise enough to handle this intense action game...BUY IT, SOLDIER!",1,0

10,Counter-Strike,"Simply THE best shooter that you can play, to forget the anger that built up inside of you after playing too much CS:GO. It truely is a relief to play another shooter than CS:GO, without messing with your aim, movement, etc.  Just set everything up the way it is in CS:GO (sensitivity, key-binds, etc.) and escape from the austerity pressure to perform well in CS:GO. And RELAX theres nothing you can do wrong here. Even when there's a cheater, just don't give a f. I mean, there isn't even a stats-record. Like there's only a serversided stats-tracking if at all. So without specifically searching for your stats on a specific server that has some kind of player-stats on it, nobody will ever know how bad you are/were :)",1,1

10,Counter-Strike,"Counter Strike is the best shooting game, i've ever played. The 'real cs', where you plant bombs etc. is not 10/10 gaming, but look at all those great mods! The greatest thing in cs is playing mod servers, and you do not need to download them from your web, you just simply double click that server, and that's it! At first I recommend to play normal cs, if it gets boring try other servers. Oh and original maps aren't that great, except de_dust2. You must try cs even if you think it has low graphics. Gameplay is much more important than graphics, remember that!",1,1

When Counter-Strike was first released it gained it's popularity immediately and become number 1 online action game, one of the most successful competitive games ever created which was easy to learn but hard to master, now Counter-Strike is dead or at least for someone because it's pro scene died in 2012, yes the pro scene is dead but the game itself is still alive, after so many years people still play and love this game, even it's pro scene lasted for unreal time, imagine it started in 2000 year and lasted for 12 years how cannot this be legendary, it's when graphics doesn't matter only gameplay.  I strongly recommend to play this game at least once if you have ever played it and enjoyed, it might not be as fun as before but I still recommend, if you like original games or havent played CS at all and started from CS:S, CS:GO doesn't matter... You should really give it a try.",1,1

10,Counter-Strike,"Quake was the first game I was ever really addicted to and focused a big portion of my time on for months or years at a time. Counter-Strike was the second - and easily more addicting. There's a reason that I still compare every multi-player shooter experience back to original Counter-Strike, to this day. There's a reason I still compare every server community to this (Counter-Strike servers each had their own community and personality and people truly got to know each other back in the day, compared to these days, where a server is just something you're automatically dumped into and feels like every other server).  Despite many iterations, nothing quite plays like the original. It's not hard to see why there are still 10,000 to 60,000 people playing this  at any one time on any day , fifteen years after launch and why it is always in the top ten games currently being played on all of Steam.  This is where it all started. Without this, there's an entire genre of shooter and multi-player that just vanishes. The original days of Counter-Strike remain the most enjoyable gaming experiences of my entire life. It's unlikely that will ever be trumped.",1,0

10,Counter-Strike,"Counter-Strike was the game that changed everything for me in FPS games, coming from older games like the FPS Game Blood back in (1997) when I was only 10 years old and Half-Life, Counter-Strike changed everything for me it was litterally the best thing ever.  The quality of the game was never about the visuals for me but about the game play and performance and Counter-Strike litterally had it all in my opinion.  Even today after so many years, I occasionally come back and play Counter-Strike just because it is one of the greatest Counter-Strike versions flat out, anyone disputing this are most likely people that started playing either Counter-Strike: Source or Counter-Strike: Global Offensive first then tried Counter-Strike but if you played it in the right order there is no disputing this, because this game might frighten most the new generation that has expectations to visual graphics having to have a certain standard before they will even touch it.  Counter-Strike is not about the visuals, that is just a bonus, if you want visuals then you probably playing the wrong game, Counter-Strike was never Battlefield nor CoD which probably to many looks visually stunning.  If you want quality in a game then Counter-Strike is one of the best games to play and get, hence why I am recommending this game.",1,1

(I still remember to this day, the character's legs weren't moving, it was on cs_siege) This was back in late 1999 or early 2000, now its allmost 2017 and I am still playing ! That is 17 years. This game has stood the test of time. Modern games are spurring like mushrooms with advanced graphics and whatnot, but none of them can give you the experience that this game can give you. I can sincerely say that there are a total of 2 maybe 3 games in all gaming history that can match this game's gaming experience. All in all I recommend this game to any new players who may come across it, who are looking for an amazing online multiplayer experience, and also a big shoutout for the old-school player as myself, don't stop playing this gem !

VALVE shame on you) - You have character selection (removed in cs:go) - you have no ranking &amp; market feature (added in cs:go, everyone plays cs:go because they think they end up as a rich-♥♥♥♥♥, also on every server there is trade spam in chat and even you get friendrequest spam from traders, also community is not looking at your skill anymore, but at your rank and not every server + singleplayer against bots has rank enabled.)  - You have no CoD clone like CS:GO  Unlike CS:GO, everyone plays this for fun, not for useless skins, money, rank etc.. also, here you cant waste 600$ for a skin.

10,Counter-Strike,"-Love to shoot people with real life guns with different names? -Have you ever dreamed to kill terrorists and even be a terrorist? -Love playing the same, universal map over and over just because it's the only map you'll ever know? (*cough* dust2) -Have you a desire to work as a team to complete objectives? -Do you know how to speak Brazilian-Portuguese and Romanian? (Awesome because many servers have players that have Brazilians, Romanians, and many other South American/Eurpoean players) -Love nostalgia? -Love to have fun? -Love getting an extra game with bots in it for free?  -Love randomly dying from wallbangs?  Great, you've come to the right game. Seriously though, despite the somewhat smaller North American community (Which is still big for the old game it is) it's probably one of the greatest games i've ever come to play, and i've only had it for about a year, and i'm gonna add hundreds of thousands of hours playing this. I don't even have actual friends that play with me yet I can still have fun with this game. From the countless recoil patterns to remember from all the guns, to the extremely friendly community (for the most part) and playing all these classic maps. Yes, of course there's hackers, you'll see a few of them, but they don't ruin the game. Either the server's admin can just ban them or you can just go to a different server, it's not gamebreaking or anything. And besides, if you get this you also get Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, which has bots. Hell, you can even download Zbots for 1.6, and it waypoints for you! Definitely get this game. This game stands the test of time.  10/10 Would throw brick-looking grenades at terrorists again.",1,1
10,Counter-Strike," Counter-Strike:  I started playing cs when I noticed jacking off isn't the only activity to do on a computer.  Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT.  CS is one of the greatest and undermined games in history. It is, in my opinion, the best game to ever have a crosshair. ",1,1
10,Counter-Strike,"If you can't get Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, this is great replacement for it. It's not as popular, but it still has a big amount of players. Some servers may be in languages you can't understand, but the game is still very fun and requires a great amount of skill. One of the best first person shooters, that still holds to this day from 1999. Although the game's graphics...aren't really the best. Even then, you can get skins, map textures, etc. to spice the graphics up a little bit. Though to me, graphics don't really matter. Highly recommend this game. 9.5/10",1,1

10,Counter-Strike,"Counter-Strike is a first-person shooter video game developed by Valve Corporation. It was initially developed and released as a Half-Life modification by Minh 'Gooseman' Le and Jess 'Cliffe' Cliffe in 1999, before Le and Cliffe were hired and the game's intellectual property acquired. Counter-Strike was first released by Valve on the Microsoft Windows platform in 2000. The game later spawned a franchise, and is the first installment in the Counter-Strike series. Several remakes and Ports of Counter-Strike have been released on the Xbox console, as well as OS X and Linux.   Set in various locations around the globe, players assume the roles of members of combating teams that include counter-terrorists and terrorists. During each round of gameplay, the two teams are tasked with defeating the other by the means of either achieving the map's objectives, or else killing all of the enemy combatants. Each player may customize their arsenal of weapons and accessories at the beginning of every match, with currency being earned after the end of each round.",1,1

10,Counter-Strike,"Yeah... the old Counter-Strike.... Everybody know, what CS is.. Counter-Strike - My rating - 9/10   Why or Why not to play this old classic ?  Positive:  It´s a legendary game, and if u playing games like CS:GO etc. u will like it, cause it will be legendary in your library. Almost everybody played CS 1.6 'from start his cs:go career' Counter-Strike 1.6 is latest and best version on the game, and if u purchase CS, u can play it, if u will download it, there´s is some chance, that u cant play it (Win 8 etc).  Most of legens/pro´s in CS:GO played CS 1.6, it´s like beginning, and it could be your beginning!   Negative: No more good tournaments on CS 1.6 (On CS:GO are tournaments like EMS, Dreamhack etc.) Graphic+Gameplay - Graphic sucks... but its still better then WarZ:P Gameplay.... yeah, crouching sucks, aiming sucks... u know... bad gameplay, if u see CS:GO, when is all so smooth, u will hate CS 1.6... but if u play CS 1.6 before then CS:GO, its good for you, and u will like it (probably:D)  So... my opinion is: It´s legendary game, everyone, who likes FPS must have this in his/her:P steam library. :)   ",1,0
10,Counter-Strike,"Counter-Strike is a pretty old game of 'shooter', which was developed in 1999, and since 2000, supported by Valve. This game immediately caught on millions of players around the world. The game is a confrontation of terrorists and counter-terrorists, representing the forces of good and evil. Objectives of the opposing sides differ depending on the map, in which the battle.  And here is my thoughs...  This is the most entertaining video game i've ever played since 2007. I think i've played this game like 2000hrs i guess, played only the cracked version in that day... I finally i bought this game and it's worth 10 bucks indeed. I still play CS 1.6 because i had an amazing childhood with it! By that i didn't mean online or with bots but i had lots of LAN-party's in my country and my friends still play it though but theres still Lan-party's sometimes in my country ^^ The game is still fun and it never gets boring! I mean todally this game has lots of gamemodes which is ZM/ZE/CSDM/GUNGAME/FURIEN/SURF/DEATHRUN/BASEBUILDER/MIX/PCW/CM/AUTOMIX/BRUSH/ARUSH and more and more and more...

10,Counter-Strike,"(I've deleted all the comments on this because I wanted to give a serious review about this game and delete my older one, so here ya go)  This is the older Counter-Strike as most people know it. Some people usually don't find enjoyment in playing it due to it being either 'out-dated' or 'glitchy'. I personally tend to enjoy this game from time to time because it's an original game made from the first Source engine, and old school shooters in general ain't too shabby either. Due to the game having a small amount of space to fill in your computer, it rarely ever lags, which makes sure of no interruptions to your enjoyment. It's also just as Competitive as the present Counter-Strike games, though there isn't any seperate Comp gamemode, unfortunately. But that's something that Valve decided to save for later purposes I suppose. Still the King of FPS Games (IMO), I would definetely recommend playing this if you enjoy tactical teamwork in your Online Gaming.",1,0

10,Counter-Strike,"This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I don't remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games.",1,0

Well, I can´t tell, whether you will like it, but the fact is, that it started one of the first big shooter franchises ever.   Pros:  -awesome gameplay -awesome gunplay -nostalgia -teambased -mechanics   Cons:  -a bit outdated though   I myself like the classic Counter Strike, but I think there should be big Skillbased MatchMaking Sites like FaceIt or ESEA (if possible even free ones), because the Competetive Mode from Global Offensive is pretty good (even though sometimes it sucks with its rank system).  I think, that it is a great game, but perhaps some players will be put off by the old graphics, but these are pretty good, if you imagine, that this game is about 16 years old.

So why CS 1.6 is dead? I beg to differ. According to spectators IEM 6 CS was the best in the tournament. I think CS 1.6 hardly died, she would die only if we want to do! As for CS: GO it grows, developers even began to read the 'Feedback', the game has changed a lot of things. Open Beta -version of the game was to be released after the new year, but I think the developers have not yet sufficiently satisfied with the result.

So I ran it through my decoder machine. And it came out as this lonely message: Trump did 7/11.  What could it mean? I'm not really sure. I'll keep you guys posted.   UPDATE #2: I've done extensive research, and it appears that this decoded message either means that Donald J. Trump owns a large chain of convenience stores, or that he is an international terrorist threat. At this point I'm not entirely sure which it is. If you have insight into this topic, please reach me at  xXilluminartyboizXx@internetexplorer.com . Thanks.   UPDATE #3: This might be my final update. I found a note slipped into my underwear when I woke up this morning. It was adressed from Valve. I opened it, naturally. Inside was one, simple sentence: Trump sees all.   Guys, listen, I don't know for sure if Trump did 7/11, or he made ISIS, or anything, but it's been fun trying to figure it out. If I don't make it to another update, and they get to me first, just tell my hamster Poochins that I loved him. Peace out.",1,1

10,Counter-Strike,"This game STILL continue to live on, but why was that? Well it was quite due to that fact that CS:Source isn't that much like by the pros since 2004 as CS:S as quoted: 'Too easy' and such, so the match for cs 1.6 grew more and more and that it was so hyped and praised and good, it still have matches even after 10 years of its 1.6 release (2003 - 2013) in which just kind of died out for CS:GO, but still, because of it's core gameplay and the fact that the commuity has been long just playing this multiplayer long and long and long, it is a game that will take long to die out, since it has a strong community base for it.  Since this game has been, well for long, then you should commonly see the use of wallhacking, cheats, aimbot, fake servers been used today, and the fact that there are quite a lot of empty servers now, but there are populated servers that are good and good community, but there are part of the community been off ever since.  It is seem a bit late to just buy and play this game, but it is still great to check it out if you are new to the cs series, or otherwise if you don't have GNU/Linux (In which I have), then you can buy Counter Strike : Globle Offensive anyway, since it is newer and (I think) has more players and pros playing it now. But if you want to have this raw action, then cs 1.6/cz would be great, you can get the bundle too if you want source as well, but source is fun to play as well.  Verdict: 9.5/10 - It still holds it place.",1,0

10,Counter-Strike,"I'll remind you: I've played CS 1.6 into oblivion on another account. 101 hours is not the full representation of my gameplay in this game.   CS 1.6 is a classic game everybody almost knows what is, at least if you are an FPS player. Of course today it is very outdated and not something you would otherwise play as your main game, but it certainly is something to take a walk through every once in a while - especially as a trip down memory lane or as a fun little LAN game to take your mind off modern games, which can get tiresome after a while (at least in my honest opinion.)   I can definitely recommend this. I played it a lot, and all the while, despite my review of it, CS:CZ had an end consensus that was a better smooth gameplay somewhat, this is one of the best games of all time. At least in terms of the FPS genre. No doubt. But if you were to play it today, you'd have to be patient as the only people still playing this online are either veterans, somewhat experienced people or cheaters (on VAC-insecure servers which there also is quite a lot of.) If you're lucky, you might still find that some of the best servers that kept the community going might still be up. Maybe.   Tread carefully, but definitely try it.",1,0

Engage in an incredibly realistic brand of terrorist warfare in this wildly popular team-based game. Ally with teammates to complete strategic missions. Take out enemy sites. Rescue hostages. Your role affects your team's success. Your team's success affects your role.  Gameplay Counter-Strike is a round based game where you play as counter terrorist or play as terrorist. As a counter terrorist, your task is to prevent the terrorist from planting a bomb and detonate it or rescue a captured hostages and lead them to the hostage rescue zone, while the terrorist team has to do the opposite. Weapons has hard recoil so you can't just spray and pray, short burst fire can save you in critical situation. Before the round begins, you can and need to buy weapons and equipments with money, you get money by winning the round or killing the enemy team. This type of gameplay encourages team work.

10,Counter-Strike,"I'm not one to criticise a game but, this has to be a great title mostly for it's 'Your role affects your team's success. Your team's success affects your role,' system even if it had many problems. The gameplay is great with plenty of user created content to play. Vanilla gameplay is not advised as it gets repetitive fast. Overall gameplay is a 8.5 out of ten. The sound isn't very good with it's annoying tracks, the only way to fix this is to download custom gun sounds but thats a pain. The sound wasn't even good in 2000 when the game came out and thats telling you something. Overall 4.0 out of a possible ten. I know this is odd for me to review a game off of this but online community. The community if few and far between, there are BARELY any good servers up and sometimes the community is awful. (still not as bad as team fortress 2 IMO XD) Overall 6.0 out of ten. Graphics usually take the backseat in my reviews but, I do have to say the graphics are OK I mean in 2000 they still weren't as good as UNREAL 1 or IDTECH 3 but they get the job done. Overall 6.5 out of ten. My verdict is that this game is good and still is I have to say this is a damn fine game earning my score as an 80% out of 100% (BTW This is all criticism because, I AM A CRITIC.)

CS 1.6 is my favorite FPS and is much better than Global Offensive in all aspects. I played this game so much before i got Steam, this game is just spetacular.

Too bad the servers are bugged I think, otherwise, still has an alright community. great gameplay and requires a lot of skill.  I love the wallbanging and the style you have to shoot. Not so much run n gun like the other games in the series.  I definitely recommend this game. Even though I doubt many people are still buying this game!",1,0

THe game modes are PERFECT, the other community gamemodes are even better! You like COD with zombies, well, this game haved zombies before COD, and better zombies. In what game are you gonna do a deathrun, where you must be alert to everything and to have skills to survive and kill a terrorist? In what game are you gonna kill zombies, while they run at full speed and all your teammates throw granades and shoot as if there was no tommorow? In what game are you gonna surf on wall? In what game are you gonna find this quantity of maps, and good maps!? In what game!?

10,Counter-Strike,"1999 is when this came out, but when I was born. Gladly though I grew up to find out and discover about this magnificent piece. There was no other game that I played once I purchased this with some B-Day cash on Steam. First time playing, I got mutilated like the noob I was, but when I started playing more often, I became better and everyone else can too.   This isn't like the CODs or Battlefields that I have played here and there today. No it's much more different. Counter-Strike is a Tactical FPS which relies on teamwork and tactics more than fast paced arcade action. You don't unlock weapons, you buy them with cash earned from kiling enemies, completeing objectives, or winning rounds although you still get a little for loosing. Think of the game as Cops &amp; Robbers. Robbers blow things up and the Cops don't them too.  On the extra note, this game has probably one of the best modding communities out there. There too much to do or put in here but I can slam a bit down. -Zombies Survival/Escape -Soccer (Or Football for the Europeans) -Surf -Bhop/KZ (Climbing Zone) -Pokemod -Gungame (Those new may have heard such from Call of Duty's spinoff) -And more, etc.  So now that I've explained the game I guess I can lay down some pro's yet con's to playing Counter-Strike 1.6  PROS -Fun/Unlimited Gameplay possibilities -Booming community that has been alive for 15 years -Plethora of servers to choose from -Competetive and Casual at the same time -Fun to play with a group of friends -More skill based than many other games out there -Cheap price   CONS -Graphics from 1998 may seem slightly offputting -Not an easy game to jump right into, as it takes lots of time to become better -May seem repetitive after a while  I came into CS late. But, I'm glad this was the first one I owned.",1,0

I play it every day, but it isn't like sometimes. Now graphic is important. Well, it isn't. I know that this game is dead already... I want to get it back, but there is no way to do that.  Cheaters are everywhere now. In every single game. You can buy cheat for CS:GO for 5$ I think... My friend bought it. I asked him : ' Why did you bought that ? Isn't it better to enjoy playing the game without cheats? ' He told me: ' I want to beat everyone. I want to be the best. No one can stop me now.

I heard about CS:GO Lounge aka CS GO betting site. Now everyone is watching matches because of skins, to get free money... Well, when I was young, in 2005. I waited with my friends a CS 1.6 match. It was beautiful. Now i sit here, and watch this CS:GO matches... So many people watch matches... But 90% watch them because of f***ing bet...  It will never be like sometimes...

10,Counter-Strike,"Counter-Strike - a series of computer games in the genre of team first-person shooter based on the engine GoldSource, originally appeared as a modification of Half-Life games.  You have to compare, so this game I will compare with СS: Source and CS: Global Offensive    Pros:    1. Battle PVP.   The multiplayer game is fully revealed the potential of the idea of the game. The most interesting part of this is. Under the bot can already tune in, but not in the real players. They can deceive, to negotiate, to use cunning tactics to create unusual ambushes.   2. The atmosphere and realism.   In all games, Valve is always a great atmosphere and I was impressed. It is evident that the developers have tried to do everything in this game, as in real life. For example, the sounds. Unfortunately, Valve released a patch in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive with new sounds and they made a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.       Minuses:    1. Cheaters.   Well, as without these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s? These sons of dogs prevent us from playing. Creators of cheats have always been one step ahead of the creators of the VAC anti-cheat. Valve is trying to improve its anti-cheat and have it turns out.I say that Valve do nothing, not worth it.   2.Graphic arts.   She was good at Counter-Strike as long as did not come out Source. I'm not picky about graphics, but after 30 minutes I start to hurt your eyes. Yes, and in general, this game proved to all that the graphics in games are not the most important thing.   3.Termination of support.

The game goes more and more players, server empty.More Valve does not release an update for Counter-Strike and does not support it in e-sports.     Conclusion:     Despite the fact that in this game there are downsides, even if they have, but still this game is legendary.

10,Counter-Strike,"RECOMMENDED JUST FOR NOSTALGIA, besides that, NOT RECOMMENDED!  It's the father to the modern Counter Strikes and FPS in general. That's a fact, but that doesn't mean you should play this. We have CSGO now, it would be ridiculous to pick up a old, outdated and dying game like CS 1.6. Those who play it do so cause they've been doing it for 15+ years, but no new players arrive and it is too much blocky graphically to be even considered for purchase these days.  Great game, but too old/outdated and dying. Don't recommend, unless you're here to get some nostalgia from the old days. (I still give it thumbs up cause it's still a GREAT game and we can't publish a analysis thinking on the time we are but on the time the game was made, to compare it to it's days instead of current days)",1,1

10,Counter-Strike,"Counter-Strike was one of the first video games I have ever played and will always be up there in my list of favorite games.  I had just installed it. It was my first multiplayer game and I though I'm too new to play against players so I played only with bots slowly progressing from easy to to the hard ones. Then one day I joined a Dust II DM server. It was chaotic, but fun. I didn't even know the map then, but I learned it by playing lots of DM. I slowly climbed the integrated server ranks and made friends with one of the admins...then after a while the server disappeared.  After that I found out about deathrun. I was horrible at it, but the regulars helped me and I started visiting the server more and more. Apparently the same server chain had a gun game server too. Now that was amazing. Completely different people played there, but again friendly ones. After a couple of months the server chain was shut down...  I continued playing aim, awp, jailbreak and other mods. I didn't even play the classic mode, it wasn't of that big interest to me, though after a couple of months I stopped playing CS.  I can't not recommend this game, because I have so many memories from it. Nostalgia.",1,0

That's ok because that's what make Counter Srike trully special, the learning curve is so steep that you'll never get bored, if you're up for the challenge of course... This game is the true tactical FPS multiplayer, many new games with fancy graphics try to accomplish what CS 1.6 did and fail terribly.  1.6 needs more love from valve, it was one of the games that made steam a 'thing', hell, back in the day it was the ONLY game to bring loyal users to the platform, the games available at the time were very reduced and steam was just an annoyance, to be completely honest we all hated steam, it was a broken nightmare.  Valve could show some love for their baby... adding trading cards, bg's and emo's or even skins would be a great start... one call only dream.. :)  tl;dr: Steam was very broken and the 1.6 playerbase kept it going, valve should recognize that.",1,0

10,Counter-Strike,Been playing CS since 2003. Despite what the box on tactical ops says no really it's not better than counter strike. CS is the best first person shooter in my opinion. The reason 1.6 is better than GO or Source is because it's about player skill not graphics. The hit boxes are much better. In order to be a great player you need to know how to execute movement even bunny hop.   Best game ever.,1,0

10,Counter-Strike,"Playing the original  (kinda, after the mod-play anyway)  CS game in 2015 has a certain nostalgia factor, bringing back fun  (&amp; sometimes bleh)  memories for those who played and supported it during infancy. 15 years ago, I couldn't have imagined Counter-Strike becoming the competitive FPS-gaming standard that it is today, especially with its latest leap into CS:GO. (Global Offensive, even while taking changes as they come, is the new favorite goose-- Carrying the Law of Newer, Faster, Bolder-- But even there, the core CS spirit &amp; experience is true. And always slowly evolving...)   It's good to look back at how far this franchise has come, as even with each controversial change or update, I know each decision is calculated with the desire to keep moving forward-- While  (hopefully)  staying as true to it's core as possible.   LONG LIVE COUNTER-STRIKE.  &amp; LONG LIVE DIXIE MAFIA. ",1,0

10,Counter-Strike,"This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I don't remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.  I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games.  I am glad that I lived through the golden era of shooters and if I'd have to rate it, it'd 10/10 ofcourse,",1,0

10,Counter-Strike,"Good old times when i played this game for the first time. I had 5 years old when i tried this game for the first time. As you know, this game is a modification of Half-Life by developers and it's a multiplayer first-person shooter. You don't have iron sight how you have in CoD or other shooter games + you need to know the weapons because they don't shoot where is the aim. It's hard to explain, but this game has so many modes and is awesome because if you buy this game, you will receive Counter-Strike Condition Zero and Condition Zero Deleted Scenes for FREE. You can play a normal shooter games with instant respawn or without it, but you can also play deathrun, surf, bhop, gun game, zombies and so on.  Pros: +The multiplayer is great +The sound is good +The graphics are very good for that year +So many play styles +So many maps +The gameplay is hard but great  Cons: -Hackers -Players who will destroy your game -Kids -VIP Servers who will OBLIGATE you to enter on their servers  This game reminded me how was the life when i was younger, so many hours in the front of PC, how i played it with friends and at school, how i ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off for the first time in a game and so on.

10,Counter-Strike,"Counter-Strike has come a long way and to see this game really brings out how much it has come. I feel as this game is not just a time waster but a reason to still be on the Internet. But In 1999, I crawled out of Counter-Strike’s wretched ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to become the man I am today. And, now, I’m tasked with rating the game. How does one even rate his mother?  In sixth grade, I would wake up for school at 5:30 AM, but then I started getting up at 4:30 just to get a couple rounds in before class. Call it dedication or a sickening obsession, but I was hooked on CS (nevermind my neighbor who broke into my house to play while I slept!) It was more than a game. It was my social hub, my iTunes visualizer, and my brief entryway into game design (which didn’t go very far.) It is and remains a standout multiplayer shooter that paved the way for things to come with Call of Duty and Battlefield.  Being eight years since the excellent Source remake, Valve has decided it’s time to give the game another facelift. What started as a Source port for consoles became a more ambitious project that included PC. While there are no radical departures in Global Offensive, it is without a doubt a reboot. Valve has just hit the reset button on the series, once again. As drastic and premature of a maneuver it may be, there is no denying that Counter-Strike remains an addictive and rewarding competitive shooter like no other.  In sixth grade, I would wake up for school at 5:30 AM, but then I started getting up at 4:30 just to get a couple rounds in before class.

I'm really sad that I started to play 1.6 just now, and also that I missed the 1.6 golden era. Even if the physics and almost everything else is really different and 'strange' I find it more relaxing to play but at the same time harder then GO. A lot of players don't even know about this game, but people listen me! If you love CS in general you have to play this game at least once and please don't crack it...you'll find only russians on that versions and everybody knows how they play at CS ;)",1,1

10,Counter-Strike,"Advantages: a good idea, an opportunity to play on a network Disadvantages: poor performance, graphics, textures, defects. Collection of my reviews on video games continues. Today we will speak about the most famous first-person shooter 'Counter-Strike'.  Igrushechki this appeared quite a long time, already in the year 2000 and won the gamers. Then all these 'shooters' were a novelty, and of course all like this game. I knew about it a long time, I heard enthusiastic talks about it, heard the word 'bots', 'contra', 'headshot of', 'ks'. And what is it, I managed to learn five or six years ago. Games then I was not 'tempted', but even then I have appreciated this game for three and a minus. Why? I'll explain later. Now the whole of the game. Created her notorious guys with the short name 'Valve'. About 'Valve's' I will say this: all of their games on the subject stopped 'fantasy' and 'half-real.' And this game belongs to the second category.  So, the creators of the idea is quite tempting. Confrontation of the law against terrorists. They gave the game the proud name of 'Counter-Strike', ie 'counter-attack', but that's just shock, as such, no intrigue in this game. And that is? There are running with a gun, a gun, a knife. Oh yes, there is another grenade (use 0). And you can take the shield (not a bad thing). We can play for the 'special forces' (which I did) and terror (very few people want). Most probably the main thing here is that we can play a 'bot' that is, our friends runs the computer, the computer runs our enemies, but we can play and through the network, where all have real people. Play over the Internet more interesting, but still 'stupid'.  I do not want to talk about any reality or fiction, but all I will say. I have not seen, not in movies, not in life, to special forces, and the terrorists jumped as the 'hare', climbed the stairs, as if running on the ground. And finally, it is that even the slightest preparation is absent, the men can not hit no shield, no weapons, no arms / legs. The hostages, but here too there are, behave calmly, stand, no one is afraid of fear or cry.  So, I criticized a little, and now tell you about the features. Game modes are different, rescuing hostages, rescue VIP-a, defusing a bomb, knife, grenade. A quest we give money, we buy ourselves, that it is necessary, for example, body armor (a rare case when it is not worn in advance on fighter (in reality)). On the job, we allocated time, which is usually enough. Each of the men says that he wants and commands that it is possible to give no one is listening. By the way, there you can sprinkle a logo that can be selected in advance. Beauty is not gaining.",1,0

10,Counter-Strike,"Lemme teach you about the Counter-Strike family history: Counter-Strike 1.6 was the eldest son. As he grew up, people came to love him as a good-hearted, generous man that was perfect in every way. As he grew older and older, the public came to appreciate the work he put in for everybody else and he soon became a household name. Him and his followers became very eccentric and stuck to the old ways. Counter-Strike: Source was the middle child. Everybody expected him to follow in his brother's footsteps but somewhere he went wrong. CS:S was a damn sight nicer than 1.6 and he was still loved by many but never achieved as much as his elder brother did, always in his shadow. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive was the youngest child. CS:GO was the child that Gooseman and Cliffe became ashamed of. They tried to hide the fact that CS:GO was completely ♥♥♥♥ing autistic but eventually it seeped out and now masses have come to love him, even though 1.6 is the best.",1,1

10,Counter-Strike,"This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2010 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2012. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games. It's harder though.",1,1

10,Counter-Strike,"Words cannot explain how great this game is. Upon the release of Half-Life, I was privileged enough to have this game (as well as Team Fortress Classic) come included with the game. I played both A LOT more then I did with Half-Life which I felt no need in playing again after beating it and the multiplayer left a lot to be desired. TFC brought me many great years of fun but like so many great games in the past, it just mysteriously died out and now I am anticipating the release of TFC2 next year. Counter-Strike, however, still has yet to die. Infact, it is a still ever growing community and easily the most popularly played FPS out today and still will be for quite some time, at least till CS 1.7 is released (if ever). I began playing this amazing game from the day the much anticipated Half-Life was released and haven't stopped since. I was what you would call a *pubmaster* for several years where I'd just walk into a pub and have fun pwning noobs but for pure enjoyment. The following years, a friend and I got into competitive play and joined CALeague. The rest, I guess you can say is history. I've played many seasons of CAL and yes, I've been out of CAL-O for several seasons (only played open for two seasons).  All in all, this game is still easily the best FPS out there even after 7 years. Pick it up, and you won't be disappointed. Do not be fooled about CS: Source, thinking it is better or that it is the future of Counter-Strike simply because it is newer. It's a really, really bad game.",1,0

10,Counter-Strike,"this game is juste, simply, clearly perfect, no game could ever get any close to it, i have CS:GO and yet i enjoy a lot more cs 1.6 then CS:GO  good points: - a classic but amazing gameplay suited for thousands and thousands of fun playing - a load of modifications and moded servers with a multitude of skins for best looking game possible (like Zm mod,ZE or BaseBuilder....) - low requirements for it, but yet it allows to play with soooo many people on internet on many servers, as anybody could run this game - very amazing low download size making it pretty much portable (400~Mb of download is still much less then other games) - and ofc, the nice spent hours with friends killing each others as well as working together (RIP to old friendships broken by this game too :P) - diversity of communities to enjoy a sociable envirement and getting new friends Bad points: - graphisme are not good for those who are getting used to nowadays games (some people might overcome this point by simply loving the simplicity of the game) - presence of annoying cheaters on servers and the small management of such problems - no single player mode and even if you fight bots, its not fun.  i think thats all for my review, i've been playing this game for like 4 years now and i still freaking enjoy it and i really recommand it to anyone with powerfull and low pc, it creates unbreakable friendship relations :v",1,1

10,Counter-Strike,"There's been a lot said about this game already, so...I'll say some more anyway, both about this entry and about the entire series.  Counter-Strike was created as a modification for  Half-Life  and quickly took on a life of its own, eventually meriting a standalone release by Valve. Its development process more or less invented the concept of the public beta. At one point around its public release, Internet traffic for the original surpassed the entire traffic output of Italy. The game itself across all its iterations can be described as easy to learn yet hard to master, like so many good games. Unlike chess and  go  however, CS primarily revolves around shooting people.  On the surface, it's simple. Counter-terrorists must stop terrorists from planting a bomb at a strategic location, or rescue hostages that the terrorists are holding. There's a handful of other modes included with the original, but they're almost never played. Players earn money over each round (more for winning and killing) to purchase more suitable guns and equipment.  In practice, rounds can sometimes end with one team being killed before any objectives can be seen to. Apart from a couple of series quirks that people have learned to love - or exploit, if they're Actual Pro Gamers(tm) - CS is pretty realistic. One shot, one kill and all of that. (No real story either, either explicit or in subtext.)   One thing CS has going for it that I haven't seen mentioned much is that you can play in bite-sized chunks if you want to. As far as I know, the reasons for it not being mentioned much are that the latest game ( Global Offensive ) has a competitive mode that encourages playing for entire matches, and that more dedicated players will often play for hours. Strictly speaking, I recommend playing in chunks: CS can get tense and difficult depending on your skill and the skill of your opposition.  However, the pacing is such that it's not exactly the hyperactive bulletfest most of today's shooters are: matches can end up as deadly games of cat and mouse as often as they erupt into firefights. Related is the fact that there is no prestige (apart from matchmaking rankings in Global Offensive) or killstreaks or what have you for players to literally level the playing field with. It can be frustrating to miss an opponent's head by a hair only for them to not miss in turn, or to be oneshotted out of the blue, but it's reassuring to know that skill is the primary factor here.  Another interesting thing is the individualism you usually see on display. Most players, especially Real Pro Gamers(tm), place a high emphasis on very skilled aiming, but a well-coordinated team that knows how to position themselves on a given map will generally have a big advantage against a team of lone wolf headshotters. CS doesn't exactly encourage team play or punish a lack of it like  Insurgency , but I will. (Encourage it, not punish the lack of it. (Much.))   This particular entry in the series still holds up; its aesthetic is more classic than dated, and you get the no-frills base gameplay that made the series what it is. If you're looking to get into the series I would still recommend  Source  or the cheaper, more modern (albeit probably more toxic) Global Offensive over this, but that's more a matter of preference and polish.  The main advantage this first entry has over the rest of its series is that you can play it on pretty much any computer these days, although Source is only a  little  more punishing on today's computers. There's a fair amount of mediocre (if somewhat classic) maps and no default bot support, but unlike the beautified expansion-slash-sequel  Condition Zero , you'll still find a lot of people in multiplayer; even more than in Source!  Please avoid Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies though. It may be based off this game, but it is bad.",1,0
10,Counter-Strike,"Counter-Strike is the mainstay of competitive shooters, with the kind of prestige the likes of Call of Duty strives so hard to achieve. A number of gameplay modes ranging from what used to be the highly popular VIP to the traditional hostage and bomb maps, to eventually leading directly to two now-released sequels and one upcoming release leaves plenty to keep one busy.  'Remember your roots.'  With simple designs to keep things tight and easy to practice (yet nearly impossible to master), Counter-Strike proves that a good shooter can stay in the forefront for over a decade.",1,0

10,Counter-Strike,"This game is a timeless classic. It's one of the perfect FPS' that will ever be made. The movement, wall spamming, hitboxes, and map choices are what make this game the best. I've been playing this game since around 2003. Have played tournaments, been an admin for many clans, and strat caller for matches. This game takes serious skill to get good at. There is a huge learning curve, and that's what seperates this from other games, and noobs and pro's. The people who will get good at this game, are the ones who put the time and effort to learn everything. While the game can be a pick up and play game. Expect your ♥♥♥ to get handed to you, as veterans of the game still heavily play this, and they'll out shoot you 9/10 times. I have been called a cheater countless times in this game, and it all comes from me playing this day and night as a child, and my skills has also transferred into other FPS games. If you get good at CS, you'll more than likely be very good at other FPS games like Over Watch, CoD, 007, etc. Thats why I nominate this game for, The “Test of Time” Award. My friends think I'm dumb for playing a game developed in the 90's, but there's a reason for it. As I said, this game is the perfect FPS. It's a game I will play until I die. I can buy any new game on the market, and I'll be returning to this game shortly after. Take it from someone who has invested a lot of time in this game to get good. It's going to seem scary at first, as you will get rekt. But you will develop friends from within the various communities, and you will get better over time. And this skill set will make you better at other FPS games. CS 1.6 forever!",1,0

10,Counter-Strike,"Life is one .. CS is 1.6 only . I will not say it is the most fav game of mine . But it doesn't strive to be the most fav game of anyone . My fav game has to be GTA ! The thing why we all love this game and we all feel the urge to say this is the most fav game is that once this game starts , the human element takes over and we actually game with our friends ( and strangers) and that's what gives us the enjoyment; the feel of competitiveness and who is the best ; to be in awe of some good player and the list goes on . The game itself is not great but the way in which it just lets the human element takes over and be the silent spectator as we enjoy and have a good time , just speaks volumes of the greatness of this game ! The game is like a silent Guardian which governs us as we enjoy our life in the 1.6 way ! GG",1,0

They are also very skilled players ingame; I often see a single player moving at the speed of sound, headshotting everyone in a blink of an eye, and getting all the praise from his fellow brethren, usually in the form of 'xiter fdp!!!'.

10,Counter-Strike,"Counter-Strike destroyed my life. I had been playing HL deathmatch, and was waiting for team fortress 2 (some of those early TF2 screens are still etched in my brain) I came across a new mod called Counter-Strike, it had just been released, Beta 1 there were only 3 maps I think and the player models were so similar that in the darkend corridors of Mansion you couldn't see who was what, so there was team killing galore, even a console command for extra money, but it was awesome, I'd never played anything like it. So I played it. ALLOT. I'd come in from college stick it on and play untill I was ready for bed, screw school work I had people to shoot in the face! Anyway I failed my A-levels and got stuck with crappy jobs, but looking back, it could possibly have been worth it, because damn I had fun! I don't know what its like nowadays, I did get fed up with the bunnyhopping AWP gits and from what I gather that is the way the game went, but this was it, where it started for me, and if you haven't played it once then you should just so you know where all your call of duty and all that balls came from.",1,0

10,Counter-Strike,"Counter-Strike is a first-person shooter in which players join either the terrorist team, the counter-terrorist team, or become spectators. Each team attempts to complete their mission objective and/or eliminate the opposing team. Each round starts with the two teams spawning simultaneously.  The objectives vary depending on the type of map, and these are the most usual ones:  Bomb Maps: The terrorists must carry a bomb, plant it on one of the designated spots and protect it from being disarmed by the counter-terrorists before it explodes to win. The counter-terrorists win if the time runs out with no conclusion. Hostage Maps: The counter-terrorists must rescue a group of hostages held by the terrorists to win. The terrorists win if the time runs out with no conclusion. VIP Maps: One of the counter-terrorists is chosen to act as a VIP and the team must escort this player to a designated spot on the map to win the game. The terrorists win if the VIP is killed or if the time runs out with no conclusion.",1,0

10,Counter-Strike,"Best game known to man-kind. No enhanced engine captures the reality of this original. 1.5 was even better. Per. Head-shot boxes have NEVER been the same and since VAC I miss seeing the cheaters getting caught Red-Handed and added to the International blacklist. I still keep a black book of every IP at the scene of any crimes. If you want to experience the original AWP trying playing OP4. Shoot opponent in the hand or foot and they are toast! If you are still mad that 'they' Cliff and whoever took the silencer off the Colt I got the SOB back. Visit  ANTPLA.NET  to get skin pack II. Original was from ~01 and is still downloadable as General Sphinx Brothers of Steel BOS skin pack. I was there playing UK's Ganstawars Last Man Standing Gameplay type messing with the bots skins trying to get CS skins on Gangstawar bots and enjoyed how one of them was invisible. Sort of like a prank. If you can tommygun invisible opponent you are like a Luke Skywalker bad a$$. Skin pack II has the 'Starwars' lightsaber replacement for knife and the AK to plasma rifle from 1980's movie 'Alien'. The skins out compete CSGO any day of the week with 400fps instead of stuck on 30 same kernel. I got a duo-core up to 1200fps. Well I should not have shared the knowlege with other gamers on the map because next thing you know everybody was doing it on their own character. [AU] DeathWish settled it when it got to CS with rainbow coloured animated reskins instead of them being invisible. My first game was CS Canyon_Siege and I was wondering why we all were moving around as ghost spectators. I am not the Prodigy Inc SPHINX. I have only made auto-admin called 3 forms of punishment. It was for Admin Mod then re-written for AMX. Lost. No need for it anymore anyway. People still found a way to hack with it and fly around the maps prior to hook and vote for matrix, etc. Give them enough rope and instead of being slapped, killed, kicked, ban was in effect for short period. Essentially you mixed 2 words with lag and server and other various buZz words like gay server all these got punishments set fourth. Talking crap about admin was a slaying. Lag was a slap. It was based off Trinity and the server was the spirit. If trash talk is about the 'spirit', that is not forgivable or rather as tolerated and the ban was automatically set. That resolved major breach of security. Suddenly there is no need to have tons of admins. Most of whom were there just to exploit code often unintentionally, due to buggy 3rd party plug-ins such as STATSME.",1,0

10,Counter-Strike,"Counter-Strike...  This game is the reason to why I got a Steam account in the first place. I got this game six years ago from a near friend of mine. Everytime I was at his place we used to play this together in turns; he played for a while, maybe 2-3 deaths then I played. We had such a great time. But... the problem was that outside his house we couldn't play the game together.   At the time my dad didn't allow me to buy the game, so my friend ended up giving it to me as a christmas present. Since that day we played it all the time. One of our favorite servers was Eropid (HS Only). He (my friend) ended up beeing in 4-5 place for a while on the server.   Overall, I've had a great time playing this game, and still enjoy playing it today. The game was the start to my FPS gaming interest and since then I've bought every CS released.  I recommed this game to anyone who wants to start play FPS games; as it is a great starting game. I also recommend that you play it with your friends; that way you will get the most fun out of it!

The answer is simple, either for nostalgia or to see how great this game was back in the time and where it all started, of course, the game version is 1.6 so it is not the oldest version but it does not matters, there could be many reasons to play this game, It got maps that aren't on Source and/or Global Offensive, It has a riot shield (even if I'm not too fan of this tactical item in Multiplayer games) and a different gameplay than CS:GO and Source, If you think Source is hard because of the recoil, of course, it's pretty similar to Source but it's a little different (or maybe It is just me) but anyway, you will get used to it quick, It's not like it was Arma... or real life.  I would suggest it to any Counter-Strike, semi-tactical, counter terrorists and FPS fans (except for those who are COD hardcore fanboys but who knows, you may change and prefer Counter-Strike to COD).  And remember this. This isn't the killing house anymore, this is real life!  9.5/10",1,0

10,Counter-Strike,"Comparing the game to CS:GO.    Pros:      Variation in lighting (darker rooms), along with flashlights and nightvision.    No background/ambient sounds in most maps (clear sound) (easier to hear footsteps and gunfire).    You can wallbang most things/walls in most maps.    Buying amunition (more depth in economical strategy).    MP5 ('nuff said)    Movement is much smoother and bunnyhopping is much more consistant and fluent, you feel much heavier in cs:go.    You can run the game on a toaster.    Character selection (I just think its pretty awesome).    Spraying (spray paint), boobs make for a great strategical distraction.    Customizing textures, maps, models ect. is great, you can mod almost anything you want, unlike in CS:GO.    No marketing system (skins), this one is a bit of a debate, personally I'm ok with skins (I've even spent money on it myself), but I prefer to mod a game rather than having to pay for a nice looking gun. Skins, simply put, are a way to milk the players money. Im thankful that CS 1.6 doesn't have this.    CS 1.6 has a classic/nostalgic feel to it, some people will like that, some people won't.    People still play the game, proving the game isn't dead yet.    There are many different and interesting modded game modes in 1.6 such as surfing, zombie, bunny hopping, jailbreak, deathmatch, gungame.     Cons:      Matchmaking in CS:GO is better, it is simpler and places you in a server with people around your level.    Grenade physics are awkward and hard to learn.    Viewing and casting games is much better/easier in CS:GO.    Few weapons are viable in CS 1.6, mostly just the AK, M4, AWP, Deagle and MP5    Sometimes bad/terrible hit registration.    Tactical shield.    No ranking system, personally, I don't care about having a pretty symbols with a bunch of arrows and stars, or having stupid rank names like 'SERGEANT MASTER ELITE SHOOTER PERSON', the only reason I'm putting it on this list is because ranking helps put players with other players that are about the level. In 1.6, any new player will find themselves playing against people leagues better than said player.    I did mention before that modded servers were great, but it can also be a problem, there are few classic CS 1.6 servers that aren't modded, most of them being deathmatch servers with 32 players, it's hard to find normal CS game modes.    Hacking is a issue in CS 1.6, worse than in CS:GO. It's harder to get VAC Banned in 1.6 and there aren't any features like Overwatch in CS:GO, to make it easier to detect hackers.    Servers can change your bindings and send you to other servers, this isn't a big problem as there are ways around it but it's still present.    The game no longer gets any updates, I know this isn't the games fault but there are still exploits and bugs in 1.6.   Some people will agree these pros and cons and some won't. I'm not saying this game is necessarily better than CS:GO, but it sure is a fun experience. I would definately recommend this game to anyone who likes FPS games, especially people who play CS:GO. The game takes a while to get used to but once you do, you will find yourself playing this game for days. I havn't played this game too much, so theres probably a lot I'm missing.

I play it now because of the fast/slow paced actions and the guns. There are a bunch of guns in Counter-Strike that you can use. There are little guns that are cheap, and big guns that are expensive. But here lies the problem with Counter-Strike... people don't even use all of the guns! Whenever I find onto a server, all of the players are only using the black gun, the brown gun, the silver gun, and the green gun. Even though there is a bunch of weapons, they aren't really all used much of the time. In the end, I play Counter-Strike because my computer is afraid of Counter-Strike: Source.",1,0

With excellent controls, skilled players, good graphics (for its time), a big variety of guns, the huge amount of servers, the anti-cheat system, good level design (official maps), Counter-Strike is one of the greatest FPS of all-time, and I think everyone should get this game as it is cheap.

Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I don't remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.  I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games.  I am glad that I lived through the golden era of shooters and if I'd have to rate it, it'd 10/10 ofcourse,",1,0

10,Counter-Strike,Best game ever can't believe it's still alive.,1,0
10,Counter-Strike,In my opinion Cs 1.6 is the best shooter game ever.,1,0
10,Counter-Strike,"Counter-Strike is only available to play in multiplayer; no bots. So you're forced to connect to someone else's server and put up with randomness and repetitive maps. And of course, it's the GoldSource Engine and all that entails.  Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is considerably more fun, in my opinion. You get all the same weapons, but there's a pseudo-story mode, AI bots to play with, and different objectives and a variety of maps you hop around, all of them challenging you in new ways. Kind of like the current campaign contracts in Global Offensive and Team Fortress 2.  Get this game (package), especially if it's on sale. If not for the classic-ness (or nostalgia), then get it for the great single-player experience with Condition Zero.",1,0

10,Counter-Strike,"Being someone who played CS:GO before this game, I must say I was pleasently suprised. The gameplay was great, and the community was quite helpful and much less toxic. I love Half Life, and this is very similar. Really fun to just do some deathmatch, I find it to be much more enjoyable then CS:GO. The bullets go where you shoot them, and hit reg is not awful. There is a much greater spread of maps here then in GO, and they are all great. The visuals and core gameplay are so simple, while providing incredible room for skill, which is rare and something I very much enjoy. The only downside and negatives of this game is that servers are often empty, but the core mechanics and gameplay are stellar.  Great pick up even for us modern gamers. It will give you a little taste of history, and what fps use to be like while providing an excellent gaming experiance.",1,0
10,Counter-Strike,Counter Strike is a great game. Even though it has outdated graphics it still has great gameplay. There are different game modes. 1 is where you have to defuse a bomb or plant a bomb and the other you have to rescue hostages and thats just to name a few. You will definetley enjoy playing this game.,1,0
10,Counter-Strike,"First at 8 years, since in 2007, A friend comed at my house and installed me a cracked version of Counter - Strike 1.6 . Well I played it like one thousand hours , my friend moved in other country, and when I was playing someone destroyed my CS. I didn't know how to install it again, so i watched on youtube ,I reinstalled it again, That story with the destroy repeats like 2-3 times. I started to be an admin at 10 years, yes 10 years baby, I was doing requests to be an admin and i was telling them i was from 15 to 25 :D Well servers that i was an admin closed , get to the next one , when this closed , to the next one and like that. I always knew that servers close because there is a lot of money to pay to have one. At 12 years i discovered Steam. The first year I did't have any friend on steam because i Haved a ♥♥♥♥ laptop and i was not able to play call of duty 1 on 30 fps. I continued to be an admin on servers. 1 year ago I discovered an server that I love, I have some great owners that are very nice, and some day the owners decided that the admins need to buy Counter-Strike 1.6 . I don't planned to buy Cs 1.6 on steam because i already have it cracked , but i loved the server so much that i buyed it on steam! I think that i have like 5000 hours of play with cracked CS's :)  I totally recommend this game! 11/10  Love CS 1.6! &lt;3",1,0
10,Counter-Strike,Bought this game (CS anthology bundle) back in 06 from a gaming store in Lamington road and it has been fun playing this every now and then whenever there are good public servers for this game. This game introduced me to STEAM platform as it was a very popular mod of Half-Life. It has been worth every penny to buy this game and I still play it more than I play CSGO.  I get reasonable pings (&lt;50) and I am on MTNL in Mumbai.  If you are newbie lookin to buy I'd recommend you buy the Valve's complete pack during a major sale.,1,0

10,Counter-Strike," PROS:  + great gameplay + big active community + great choice of weapons + huge amount of mods + lots of community created maps, weapons, AI, soundtracks, etc.   CONS:  - rare issues with graphic cards (especially for laptops) - has replacement in form of newer CS games   Comment:  What is there to introduce? This is a FPS game that most gamers know and the ones that don't should. The laughable half an hour I have displayed here was just testing out the newly bought game. In reality I have played many many many hours with my friends. I played it in high school. I played it in college. I played it with friends after work. While the graphics may be old and this game replaced by its' younger sibblings it still holds out the test of time. While I am no longer able to get my friends together and play this , this game will always be a fond memory for me. And who knows maybe I will pick it up some day again. What I can do is recommend this game to anyone who has not played it or people who are thinking about pruchasing this digital copy. The basic concept of terrorists vs. counter-terrorists is really fun and with the modding community the amount of variation is almost limitless. So grab it if you can, it is very much worth it.",1,0

I can't think of ANYONE in my hometown that did not play this game (BEFORE STEAM even existed) This was the game that brought us all together on weekends, schoolbreaks and we even went as far as moving large CRT monitors just to game. I would like to see the lazy youths of today arrange a LAN where everyone had to carry a large 19inch CRT monitor with them :)  All the drunken insanity of 20youths in a basement-LAN (NO INTERNET!), killing eachother and sharing files on DC++.

10,Counter-Strike,Bought this game (CS anthology bundle) back in 06 from a gaming store in Lamington road and it has been fun playing this every now and then whenever there are good public servers for this game. This game introduced me to STEAM platform as it was a very popular mod of Half-Life. It has been worth every penny to buy this game and I still play it more than I play CSGO.  I get reasonable pings (&lt;50) and I am on MTNL in Mumbai.  If you are newbie lookin to buy I'd recommend you buy the Valve's complete pack during a major sale.,1,0

This game is totally worth buying if you like playing in cooperation with friends. 2 team are tying to kill each other with one life. Point is: Terrorists are supposed to destroy a bombsite and Counter Terrorists are supposed to defend it. It works the same in hostage rescue, CT has to take hostages to safety. But if you are looking for a counter strike and good graphics, don't look here. Try CS:Source or Global Offensive.",1,0

10,Counter-Strike,"Am I really writing a recommendation for this game?  Counter-Strike  or CS 1.6  is a classic game which started off as a Half-Life 1 mod way back in late 1999, and was later sold in 2000 which required both Half-Life 1 and the game itself. Where as now, you only need the game itself on Steam.   Counter-Strike was one of the biggest multiplayer FPS games ever made, due to it being playable on many computers, and just an overall really fun game. It has no doubt made a huge impact on the world of FPS. Especially in the competitive scene such as e-sports where 1.6 is still being played today.  However, it has aged. A lot. Especially in comparison to Counter-Strike: Source. So a lot of maps are quite spacious and don't look as realistic as many would expect to todays standards.   I actually prefer CS:S over this game as I just like the feel of it more.  I honestly don't know why I'm reviewing this game, as I'm sure everyone on my friends list here has played it. But just incase you're that one odd person out that for osme reason hasn't played it - try it out, and see whether you like it or not. ",1,0

I collected alot of great and horrible experience on that game.  Storytime: After learn of the systemmatic of the game. I learned how to shoot. Located the best spots. Choosed the best maps(dust/2, assault..) and rised up to landscape of custom mods as been known the 'heart of Counter-Strike' It begun with Only Knife maps and bringed me up to Surfing, Kreedz.. And after hours and hours of learning. I became extremly skilled. This was the best highlight on this game for me, to stand on a point where you reached the point and can finally say You unterstand this game and his shematics ( movements, angle, strafe, and much more..)  *Nostalg* I might be coming back to this title ... maybe not today or tommorow.. someday, it will happen...",1,0

10,Counter-Strike,"This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I don't remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games.",1,0

10,Counter-Strike,"Never before has a multiplayer game blended all the elements of true competition and sweat-soaked-shirt anxiety as well a Counter-Strike (CS). You probably already know CS as one of the most popular modifications for Half-Life. It's been available for download for over a year, at least in beta form. But unless you've got a super fast Internet connection at your house, you may not have played it yet as the nearly 100 megabyte download may be daunting for those of you not fortunate enough to have a high-speed connection. Thankfully CS has turned into a full-blown retail game and, while the two versions of CS are identical, it certainly worth shelling out $10 for this stellar title...plus you get a few more multiplayer goodies in the retail package to boot.  Let me start off by saying that the Counter-Strike pack is a stand-alone product. You don't need the original Half-Life to play this game. In the retail package you get a full version of CS as well as Team Fortress Classic, Opposing Force multiplayer, and the Wanted, Redemption and Firearms mods. The entire pack is overflowing with multiplayer fun, but, of course, the real focus of the retail release is Counter-Strike.  There is a single-player component to CS and, while it provides a good primer, this mod is all about online action. You basically play a game of cat and mouse, with the mouse being a terrorist group and the cat a squad of counter-terrorists. As a terrorist, you're goal is to plant a bomb at a specific location or hold a group of hostages. As a counter-terrorist, it's your duty to defuse said bomb or rescue the ill-fated hostages. Taking out all players on the opposing side will also assure your victory.  CS is an action lover's dream, with games lasting only four or five minutes (if that in some cases) because, unlike Half-Life, one shot to the head can mean instant death. CS is the perfect mix between fast-action and realistic damage. You can't just absorb bullet after bullet and expect to walk away. Working as a team is a must and, while you're in the game, taking the lone wolf approach will often get you killed...and fast.  It's the team-based tactics that make CS so fun. I can't stress how important it is in this game to act as a team. If your team is on the defensive side you'll all benefit by creating a cohesive strategy. If you team is on the offensive side, you will all benefit by sticking closely together as well. I'm sure you've seen movies or television show demonstrating this 'Conga Line' style of infiltration. Well, that's exactly how your team will have to act. This creates a fantastic game balance that will keep you coming back for more. It'll also keep you from thinking about your school work, your job, and interaction with your loved ones, and often work around the IGN offices will be put on hold so we can clog our network with CS.  Visually the game will not disappoint. While the Half-Life engine isn't the prettiest beast out there, there is plenty of animation that creates a smooth look and feel, and the gun models are some of the most realistic looking of any shooter available. The environmental textures look realistic enough and complement the provided camouflage well enough for you to be hidden, but not be invisible. As in real life, the distinguishable difference between good guy and bad guy is a little difficult, but the balance to this is if you can't tell who it is then you probably won't be able to hit him with your gun. Now, if you've purchased sniper rifle, you should have plenty of scope magnification to tell the difference between terrorist or counter-terrorist, but otherwise you may be taking out a team member from afar.  As good as it is, a couple of features of this game really stood out as frustrating... at first. But over a period of time they actually became enhancements to online multiplayer gaming. One feature is buying your weapons at the start of each round. This takes a little getting used to at first since, in most shooters, you just run around picking up weapons at your heart's content. Usually by the time you figured out which guns, grenades, and armor you were going to take in your early games, the bad guys would come over and kill you. But a couple of tries later, after getting the gist of things, you're off in no time. The other feature that took some getting used to was the 'wait and watch' feature after you get killed. Once you sustain a lethal injury, you have to wait for the next round to start before you can join in again -- you don't just spawn again and start shooting. This actually adds a ton of anxiety to your efforts of staying alive and completing your objective. But like I mentioned before, the rounds are short, so you shouldn't have to wait too long before you can jump in the action again.  Not surprisingly, the user interface is very Half-Life-esque. Gamers who have played Half-Life or any of the other mods for the game will have no trouble with the menu system. Even for the first time user the interface is easy to use or fumble through. The only thing that even slightly tripped us up in the interface is the 'Update' on the server page. First-time users may be confused into thinking this meant update my version of CS. Not true, it actually means update the list of game servers. But the rest of the interface is easy to understand and even easier to navigate.  Just about the only aspect of this game that we could make negative comments about is the sound. Sure, the realistic guns sounds are spot on, we just wish the same amount of attention to detail was given to the rest of the sound in the game. Some levels have lighting and thunder. When the thunder crashes it sounds a little wimpy. We were hoping for some deeper bass and clearer sounding claps from the lightning. In most of the level the user can go inside or out side of buildings, the sound of their footsteps should also change to reflect what type of surface they are walking on. The sound of footsteps getting closer and closer could also have been improved. As it stands now, it's hard to tell how far down the hallway or street a bad guy is from you by sound alone.  So how long does the magic last? Well we've been playing this game for over a year now and we still can't get enough of it. Are we tired of it? Hell no! We're still surprised by how fun this game is. This game actually made some of us squeal like little school-girls after getting sniped from an unexpected angle on high. On the other hand some of us were drawn to stand up and scream obscenities at the monitor. I guess we'll just have to get them next time!  In a nutshell, if you're looking for the next step in online first person shooters, then look no further. CS is fast paced, intense, and satisfying--this game will not disappoint. This is truly one of the best mods for one of the all time greatest first person shooters ever, and the retail package of CS is simply bursting with multiplayer goodness. If you like to play shooters online, get this pack!",1,0

This is just like the other CS games, You play as a Terrorist and Counter Terrorist. The objective of the Terrorist is to use the C4 and blow up 2 area's, Either one could do. A or B. While the Counter-Terrorist's objective is to Stop the bomb from being planted, If it is planted, They have to eliminate all Terrorist and Defuse the bomb. It takes around 5 second's or 10 to defuse, It depends if you have a defuse kit. It's a good game and i recommend it.",1,0

10,Counter-Strike,"You are 14 years old, first time trying to play something multiplayer and online. You see this game, since you have a potatoe PC you start to play this game. Runs smoothly on 53 FPS, woow sounds are great, look an AK-47 but name CV-47 you play it you shoot, you get killed asking yourself how you didn't kill him cause you shot 27 bullets on that guy and he still is alive. You play it over and over, finally getting your first kill. (cause the enemy was coruching and looking the other way and you instantly kill him running 17 bullets spent) you get high hopes, I can play this game it is so easy. You get more kills, you get greedy you rush alone you get killed when you even thought about rushing by an AWP on mid. Ages pass, poeple pass, kills get comon. You start to play better, after 2 years you learn the recoils you learn the hidding spots, you know what is the enemy's next move. You practise your awp then. You play DM and DM only with an awp, your kills are slick, and your flicks are quick and accurate. Admin invites you to his clan. FIrst time you play this game with somenone for serious. You can't do anything cause you are not used to an opposite player to play smartly and you get owned, you don't do kills and your teammates question your skill. Couple more months pass you learn your duties as a teammate. You give info you cover you open. Clan gets closed down, you find another clan you are one of the best players. You play more switch clans for better ones. You get to LANs you get scared of the all expecations and so many eyes on you. You tilt and miss your shots, months pass, you get better, you become a man of steel and high nervous, 2000 hours pass you are finally a great player. 10 000 hours pass, you win LANs you play against better players, you try a gainst payed players you are toe-to-toe with them but you loose cause your team isn't on that level and they get scared. 20 000 hours pass game is dying and so is your love for this game. But no one can pay thoose voice chats from 8 P.M till 6 A.M every weekend with your friends. So much hours in this game and you acomplished nothing. You play against your local teams you get banned cause they don't expect somene to play that good without cheats and you stop playing this cause cheaters take over, very 12 year old first downloads a cheat then this game. You get mentally tortured cause the kid is telling you how bad you are and that you suck, you cry inside. Thinking what happened to me, how come this kid plays better then me, then you figure out the cheats are great, but you still play it fairly. You cry cause no one cares for e-sports in your country and no one wants to pay you for playing games. Your parents tell you you don't have a life you loose some friends, you loose your girlfriend you stop being active in sports. YOu just play this game hoping to be recognised, but you don't so to help everyone in this world after 30 000 hours on this game, don't play it it is a sinking ship and it is pulling you down. Tears are in my eyes for all the time I was good but now you can't play a normal match since cheaters will destory you... run READER, move away, press back and never turn back on this game..",-1,1

10,Counter-Strike,"Counter-Cstrike 1.6 is one of the best FPS games. You can do almost anything in it, which is pretty awesome, at least for me, when the player can modify things to his/her liking. You can choose from many modes, ex. Knife, Awp, Aim, Deathmatch, Surf, KreedZ, Zombie, CoD MW2, W3 FT and so on. You can change models/skins, try almost anything if not everything. It is a shame that so many people did not see its potential, but ofcourse, the time goes on &amp; the era changes, but no matter what, Counter-Cstrike 1.6 will always be my n1 OldSql game. Frankly speaking, I reccommend to try out this game to any FPS game lover, because I think he/she will not regret it. It is year 2o15 &amp; its community still lives, maybe with one foot in grave, but lives on. Thanks for any reader &amp; his time reading this.  Regards,  iMIND™ ",1,0

10,Counter-Strike,"Counter-Strike makes you work to enjoy the content, and you'll have to put many hours of play into it before enjoying the feeling of conquering it.  Weapons are a huge part of the series too, with CS:GO not an exception. Each round provides a cash sum based on your previous performance, and with this you can purchase armour, projectiles and weapons. Firearms range from standard assault rifles to shotguns and sniper rifles, and you'll want to experiment with each one to see which works best.  What makes Counter-Strike such a popular series - and what will no doubt make CS:GO the next big PC shooter - is the thrill of the ego chase. As you die, often continuously, the frustration is outweighed by an aspiration to do better. In a game where success is pinned on attention to detail, death often triggers an internal failure analysis that the player will mull over while waiting for a new session to load. It becomes a spiral of egging yourself on to do better - and if you become a good player, the game becomes a stage for you to parade your skills.  Global Offensive builds on the CS series by going through a significant checklist presented by its community and marking off as many points as possible. Gun game as its own separate mode? Check. Competitive capabilities built in? Check. Map balancing here and there? Check, check, check.  As a result, there are numerous upgrades that will adjust gameplay while also making accessibility far better. The wide range of grenades, for example, will likely make play more tactical - laying down incendiary grenades will thwart rushes, while decoys, which fake gunfire and fool radar points, are brilliant tools for messing with the minds of established players.  The actual core shooting will be a huge talking point for many months to come. It has been tinkered slightly and gives weapons a noticeably floaty feel, which doesn't sit well to begin with. We eventually found ourselves enamoured by it, and the impact of hits add a real tactile distinction to play.  It's what doesn't work, however, that is most notable. Regular mode has no new maps added to it, while all the new guns seem somewhat cosmetic. Global Offensive has also removed some of its middling weapons such as the MP5, essentially pushing even more players to stick with the AK and the M4. Sometimes it gives the impression that there is in fact less valuable content than in previous CS releases.  If one assumed this was Counter-Strike Source with a visual mod installed, there would often be little to shake that impression.  There's also now a split between casual and competitive servers - however, many players aren't yet aware of the differences, mainly because the distinction isn't made obvious enough. It becomes even more confusing if you join a community server with all hosts of mods installed on it, which have perhaps taken casual mode, turned friendly fire on and essentially made it as close to Source as possible.  At times, arranging games in Competitive Mode feels like a chore. Joining a five-on-five war is simple enough, but attempt to lobby up with a group of friends and join a game, and you'll often hit a snag. Myself and a few others tried to find a competitive game with no luck, simply being told that no servers were currently available.  When you finally do join, it works fine, but the wait and work required to find a game seems like a drawback. We eventually gave up and resorted to using IRC to find matches, as we would with Source.  Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is not the key evolution point that we were hoping for, and the response from the community often reflects this view. On many occasions, other players used phrases such as 'same old' to us.  This is elementally Counter-Strike Source with some fine-tuning under the bonnet, and Valve appears to have acknowledged this with the reasonable RRP attached to it.  And yet the core DNA of the game has not lost its appeal. This is still a glorious experience that sets a benchmark for all multiplayer shooters. Valve's objective with Global Offensive was to draw together the active communities of both the Source and trusty 1.6 edition. It clearly has a good chance.",1,0

10,Counter-Strike,"A great game of cat-and-mouse where you either play as a terrorist (plant bombs or hold hostages) or counter-terrorist (defend bombsites or rescue hostages). Either complete those objectives or kill all players of the opposing team to win the round.  Counter-Strike is a fast-paced, realistic shooter that encourages teamwork so play with a friend (it's also more fun). The graphics hasn't aged well but the guns still looks authentic. One thing I hate about Counter-Strike is when you die, you have to sit and wait until the round ends. Even if the rounds are usually short, it's frustrating and it puts a ton of anxiety to your efforts of staying alive. Fortunately, Counter-Strike has tons of mods available so you're able to play the game in many different ways. This helps the game from becoming monotonous and keep the game fresh.  There's also not a lot of detail in the sound, other than the guns, but that's a minor complaint. The mods, dedicated servers and competitive nature of the game is what holds this game together to this day and that's why millions of people still play this old-school game. Although there are many better shooters on the market now, Counter-Strike's unique gameplay is what keeps me coming back from time to time.  8/10 - GREAT GAME",1,0

I couldn't find a lobby that wasn't full except for one lobby with only a single guy playing with bots in a TDM game. Now this guy was either really good at CS or hacking but i've never gone 15+ deaths 0 kills by the same guy. Another interesting thing to note is how the maps are vastly different from their counterparts in CSGO which isn't a bad thing just interesting. Secondly, there is a lot less spread in the guns than there is in CSGO a long with a different types of weapons...well for most the only difference was the name of the gun. Also there were more options for CT and T teams. Interesting to play probably won't play again but hey i need it for GMOD reasons.",1,0

10,Counter-Strike,"Made by Valve Software in 2000, originaly a mod for Half-Life in 1999. The most recently update is known as version 1.6. This game isn't balanced: the Desert Eagle is TO overpowered, USP too, rest of the pistols are mostly useless. The SMGs are quite good, but not as good as the Assault RIfles thoe. If you play this game right now, then expect little kids, russians, or just some wierd guys, who somehow see trough walls and always kill you with a one shot in the head... But renember: this game is amazing, alot of nostalgia for it. I would recomend to buy Counter Strike: Global Offensive, because it is more balanced, better movement, actual physics, and renember: you CAN earn money!! (when new cases come out, just play the hell out of it, there is a good chance that you'l get it in a drop)",1,0

10,Counter-Strike,"Despite my hilariously low count of, 0.6 hours, on record, I can attest to you that, nay, I have played this game(and it's 'sequels') to the ends of time. I've literally sunk close to 15,000 hours into the various derivations of CS over the years.  I found out about CS from some #IRC chat I used to frequent back in the day(it might have been an ICQ chat with one of them). Namely, I started with the first ALPHA(yea, not beta, ALPHA). I can recall the loading screen and everything. From there, I progressed through the initial betas, introduction of maps, and various weapons(anyone remember the OLD cs_siege, complete with working apc and sniper tower?), etc.  I then became a player in various 'leagues'; I won't name drop, but I was a baller at one time.  So, yes, this game is good. Some people recommend CSGO as the 'modern' return of 1.6, but I disagree. CSGO is better than CSS, yes, but still not on-par with 1.6, nothing will ever be :(  Goodbye WON-servers.",1,0

10,Counter-Strike,"This insightful and damning critique of the military-industrial complex deserves to be highlighted for its trenchant social commentary as much as for its streamlined, highly polished gameplay. This is a multiplayer shooter with two teams, 'terrorists' and 'counter-terrorists,' but tellingly the player shuffles between the two with ease and there are basically no differences between being on one side or the other, save for their objective, which is often to plant a bomb on nothing of value or rescue 'hostages' who disappear immediately when rescued, as if they were created solely to sustain the conflict. Both teams purchase their weapons from the same supplier with money they earn from fighting each other: endless soldiers fighting an eternal war driven not by ideology but by the military industrial complex, where fighting simply leads to more money and more fighting rather than an eventual peaceful resolution.

10,Counter-Strike,"At first a third-party mod for Half-Life Deathmatch, Counter Strike became one of the most recognized and accoladed FPS's amongst the PC gaming community, and 1.6 is still going strong with hundreds of servers available free-to-play worldwide, even after the release of Source (the newer version of CS using the HL2 engine).   Nothing comes close to the intuitive physics and control provided by the old-school Half-Life 1 engine. Clever map design, in combination with a wide (but not overly-acclectic) collection of firearms and equipment at your disposal make for exciting deathmatch-style firefights as well as situtions requiring strategy and coordination with teamates.   The beauty of this game is it's simplicity, and diversity of action: There are no classes, no upgrades or bonuses, and nothing giving any player any sort of in-game advantage over another, save for skill and knowledge of the game. A large arsenal of uniquely-tuned weapons, CS's worldwide appeal and player base, and a plethora of every map type you could possibly imagine make for some very memorable gameplay experiences.",1,0

10,Counter-Strike,"Counter-Strike (officially abbreviated as CS) is a series of multiplayer first-person shooter video games, in which teams of terrorists and counter-terrorists battle to, respectively, perpetrate an act of terror (bombing, hostage-taking) and prevent it (bomb defusal, hostage rescue). The series began on Windows in 1999 with the first version of Counter-Strike. It was initially released as a modification for Half-Life and designed by Minh 'Gooseman' Le and Jess 'Cliffe' Cliffe, before the rights to the game's intellectual property were acquired by Valve Corporation, the developers of Half-Life.  The game was followed-up with Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, developed by Turtle Rock Studios and released in 2004. Later that same year, Counter-Strike: Source was released by Valve. Released only eight months after Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, in November 2004, the game was a remake of the original Counter-Strike and the first in the series to run on Valve's newly created Source engine.[1] The fourth game in the main series to have been developed by Valve, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, was released in 2012 for Windows, OS X, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. Hidden Path Entertainment, who also worked on Counter-Strike: Source post-release, helped to develop the game alongside Valve.[2] Several spin-off titles have been released for Asian territories.",1,0

10,Counter-Strike,"Never have been a huge CS fan. Never used to be a legitamate player.  That's where Counter-Strike 1.5/1.6 comes into play. Among the other Counter-Strike games I have cheated within them, multiple accounts, and have been banned more than my 2 year old sister can count. By the way, she can count to 22. After been given the opportunity to try the very first, at least on Steam, Counter-Strike 1.5/1.6, I have come to realize that I have no need to cheat. I can play this game on a competitive skill and strive to be better.  Do I recommend it? Yes.  Much more to say besides it turned me to be a legitmate player? No.  That should say enough.  Buy it, it's cheap. Good for its price and it will make you play legitmate.",1,0

10,Counter-Strike,Counter-Strike is a game that I recommend because: - is one of the legends from the category shooting - is cheaper than the rest from the category shooting - is a method to banish boredom  - is a good method to increase your performance at aim - you can easy change the type of default skins by the skins from internet - have a fair VAC staff - and... why you don't try?

Don't get me wrong, I love games from this era like Quake, HL1 and I still enjoy those more than newer entries, but I just can't see why you would buy this when CS:GO is miles better for a tiny increase in price. In this case, its a matter of whether the game holds up against it newer entries or (by itself) and I just don't feel that this fulfills those properties.",-1,0

10,Counter-Strike,"Counter-Strike is a tactical first-person shooter video game which originated from a Half-Life modification and features real-world weapons.  Counter-Strike pits a team of counter-terrorists against a team of terrorists in a series of rounds. Each round is won by either completing the mission objective or eliminating the opposing force. The game has both individual and multiplayer options. Bots can be added into the game. The online-multiplayer option is activated via Steam.  Other than similarities in basic gameplay, Counter-Strike is not in any way related to Half-Life. The original version was marketed as a commercial mod, but since then it has grown into a separate game in itself.",1,0

Counter ones needs to do the opposite, defuse or deny the bomb (at de_maps) and get the hostages back (at cs_maps). There are a lot of mods, if you dont like the classic mode.

Now, important information: do not be fooled by the amount of hours marked by Steam. There, when the beta versions were launched in 1999, when the game was free. Then 1.6 was launched until about 4 years ago, I had it in a different account, which I do not own anymore. Over a decade of gaming, several hours every day, which certainly have accumulated thousands of hours. By far the most played game throughout my life... You see, the first sentence that illustrates this review was not chosen at random. I had to stop playing completely, cold turkey, or I would fail high school. Just decided to buy it again and play for nostalgia sake. I'm not afraid, I'm much more self controlled now and the fact that I'm not even half as good as before, kinda takes away the compulsion to play.

10,Counter-Strike,"Counter-Strike is a first-person shooter game in which players join either the terrorist team, the counter-terrorist team, or become spectators. Each team attempts to complete their mission objective and/or eliminate the opposing team. Each round starts with the two teams spawning simultaneously.  The objectives vary depending on the type of map, and these are the most usual ones:  Bomb defusal: The terrorists must carry a bomb, plant it on one of the designated spots and protect it from being disarmed by the counter-terrorists before it explodes to win. The counter-terrorists win if the time runs out with no conclusion. Hostage rescue: The counter-terrorists must rescue a group of hostages held by the terrorists to win. The terrorists win if the time runs out with no conclusion. VIP escort: One of the counter-terrorists is chosen to act as a VIP and the team must escort this player to a designated spot on the map to win the game. The terrorists win if the VIP is killed or if the time runs out with no conclusion. A player can choose to play as one of eight different default character models (four for each side, although Counter-Strike: Condition Zero added two extra models, bringing the total to ten). Players are generally given a few seconds before the round begins (known as 'freeze time') to prepare and buy equipment, during which they cannot attack or move. They can return to the buy area within a set amount of time to buy more equipment (some custom maps included neutral 'buy zones' that could be used by both teams). Once the round has ended, surviving players retain their equipment for use in the next round; players who were killed begin the next round with the basic default starting equipment.  Standard monetary bonuses are awarded for winning a round, losing a round, killing an enemy, being the first to instruct a hostage to follow, rescuing a hostage, planting the bomb (Terrorist) or defusing the bomb (Counter-Terrorist).  The scoreboard displays team scores in addition to statistics for each player: name, kills, deaths, and ping (in milliseconds). The scoreboard also indicates whether a player is dead, carrying the bomb (on bomb maps), or is the VIP (on assassination maps), although information on players on the opposing team is hidden from a player until his/her death, as this information can be important.  Killed players become 'spectators' for the duration of the round; they cannot change their names before their next spawn, text chat cannot be sent to or received from live players, and voice chat can only be received from live players and not sent to them. Spectators are generally able to watch the rest of the round from multiple selectable views, although some servers disable some of these views to prevent dead players from relaying information about living players to their teammates through alternative media (most notably voice in the case of Internet cafes and Voice over IP programs such as TeamSpeak or Ventrilo). This form of cheating is known as 'ghosting.'",1,0

Find another server don't sit on one server, or go to Steam-only server. People play this game only for fun, there are no ranks(not talking about server's specific ranks), that's the most important thing. Of course teamgame on this mostly dissapeared, people play only by theirselves, but that's good, you know why? You will never get nervous if your teammate fails to defuse the bomb or something like that, because you play by yourself. Talking about game modes, oh God there are so much modes, starting from Surf ending with Zombie Plague. You can play this with your friends easily, cause there are no rank restrictions. The ban system and other things like amx_ban or amx_kick are highly fixed and upgraded at maximum. You can put whatever skins you want from CS:GO and so on, and use it without any restrictions. This old - school game is being massively played for 16 years now and i think that after 10 years he's going to be played still.  Highly recommended!",1,0

10,Counter-Strike,"Ok, I admit, I played this game back in my childhood on my original Xbox, and had so much fun. Not too long ago I reinstalled it for my computer, but when I did, I HATED it. I couldn't play right. People would one tap me from the side of the map, others will just be an absolute pro with the AWP making life so hard. Theres no mercy for new players, there's no official Valve servers, only the community servers which take away the classic feel. I have probably only joined 2 servers that have none of the stupid annoying Quake sounds. No 'double kill' or 'dominating' just classic CS 1.6. It was aggrovating for me, my favourite childhood game gone to waste, or so I thought. I was just bad at the game. I was scared to do anything. If I pushed in first, I thought I would get destroyed immediately. The guns felt weird and ridiculously inaccurate, the game didn't FEEL right, and anything I tried would ultimately fail. Well, until a couple of weeks ago.   I played violent. I played smart. I played gruesome and unforgiving. Getting 4 man spray downs and one-double tap headshots across the map. I was ruthless, relentless, and I enjoyed it. This game was starting to be fun for me, not as annoying, not as frustrating, only fun, as I always wanted it to be. The thing is I learned not to be scared, the same with CSGO. I played CSGO, sucked at it, played horribly until I just began to not care if I died. That was when I began to play better. CS 1.6 came, and I began to be horrifying. Enemy teams would scream at me, I would laugh and continue, their unfornate moments was fuel to my wrath, until, of course as it always happens, a pro AWPer comes towards me and 420 swagscopes me in the face. Rage quit.  11/10 would get Blazed it again.",1,0

10,Counter-Strike,"The games dead. Its basically worthless to anyone in USA unless you want to play with third worlders. Even then theres only a few servers it looks like. I would rather die than play with South Americans. Anything south of the US border is just hell ( I have never had a positive experience online with these people and if you know anything about geopolitics I need not go into that), so I advise not dealing with these peoples idiocy and just going with CSGO these days unless you want to LAN this game.  One of the greatest FPS games to ever come out and will forever remain a classic but also a game that can still compete design and gameplay wise with games released in more current times. We will never have the natural form of support from players and ESPORTS ever again. This is before ESports was just a way for devs to market and shill a game. This was from when people who liked to play a game competed and not just a bunch of rich kids trying to win monetary prizes like ESports is now (who else could play CSGO all day erry day in this economy?)  People got behind this game because they liked it, instead CSGO is all about market manipulation and human psychology manipulating with less consideration about gameplay because they want the most monetary return. If the idiots will pay hundreds for a digital knife skin then why would any company invest in gameplay that won't have direct returns like a digital nongood would have?  The video game market is full of idiots who will dump money into anything now just so they can distract themselves from the politcs, economics, and slowly declining living conditions of the western world. Bread and circus in its truest form.  CS 1.6 is from better days, more honest days. When people who wanted to make games, and people who wanted to play games were very closely related and the average IQ of someone who was online was higher than now. These days every idiot has an internet connection. That is to say, the target audience then was just better than the target audiences of todays games. This is exampled many times in economics.

I can understand why alot of people have trouble letting go of the past, and playing all the games they did when PC gaming started to become more relivent, but common, there are so many better looking, newer games out there that people dont give a chance.

10,Counter-Strike,"Seinfeld is an American sitcom that originally ran for nine seasons on NBC, from 1989 to 1998. It was created by Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld, the latter starring as a fictionalized version of himself. Set predominantly in an apartment building in Manhattan's Upper West Side in New York City (although taped entirely in Los Angeles), the show features a handful of Jerry's friends and acquaintances, particularly best friend George Costanza (Jason Alexander), former girlfriend Elaine Benes (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), and neighbor across the hall Cosmo Kramer (Michael Richards). It is often described as being 'a show about nothing', as many of its episodes are about the minutiae of daily life. ",1,0

10,Counter-Strike,"DON'T FALL FOR NOSTALGIA BIAS  Pros: -classic feel  -people still play it(barely) -no skins(almost)  Cons: -80% of the players are hackers and do not speak english(so no real teamwork) -real servers with the gamemode actually being a CS type are almost non-existant -actual enjoyability comes from whether or not you like to deal with the above  This is one of gamings most treasered games and it is sad to see it get like this. Nostalgia can only get people so far and it is a shame thaat few people explain the reality of this game in their reviews. The fun is not totally gone, although it is something you have to really try to find. The gameplay is as you would expect it (at least when you find a server that doesn't have CSGO surfers on it), nothing has changed and thats good. The problem is the community. It is hard to find a server with a team you can communicate with because of the major language barrier the game now has.  Communication is key in this game as you would expect, and it is very rare because almost everytime you get on a server it is from a central american area and the players mostly speak spanish. Making it difficult as you would expect.   The amount of hacking in this game shameful, it is more common than it is in CSGO and is a real problem that makes the experience more bad than it already has become.  The server types are just like what you would see in an old game, modded to hell with new terribly unenjoyable game modes. If you were to see you would find many gameplay modded servers that give you trash that nobody wants to see (surfing).   Take away the nostalgia bias that everyone tosses out and you will see that this game is a former shell of itself. It has all the elements of a typical old PC game that only a few people will try hard enough to enjoy. The enjoyment can still be found, but at a heavy heavy cost. RIP CS1.",-1,1

I fiddle with the settings, and theres no damn graphics options! I put the crosshair on small.(Definitely not small) So, I go to servers and all the servers have horrible maps. Plus, closest servers had 0 players. I click on a Dust 2 server with 10 players. When it loads up, nobody speaks ♥♥♥♥ing english. The buy menu controls were so ♥♥♥♥ed up I couldnt buy a gun. So, I stuck with the pistol. I go through the middle, and all the players look the same! You cant even tell who's who. Literally, the ♥♥♥♥ing same. So I die instantly because i couldn't even tell it was an enemy. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I finally managed to buy a gun in the ♥♥♥♥ed up menu. I find someone, spray at em', and surprisingly it was enemy. My gun starts shooting in the ♥♥♥♥ing sky, recoil over 9000, and I was burst firing! Absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Another HORRIBLE thing about this game, its graphics and audio! It just doesnt meet todays standards. I think I might have to bleach my eyes after glancing at this game. Its horrible. I only played the game for under 10 minutes and I already want to kill my self. Trust me, save your money. If you loved this game as a kid, I dont care get it. But if youre looking for a good FPS, to TODAYS standards, dont get this garbarge!

10,Counter-Strike,First please read the review because there are a lot of fanboys who downvote all negative ones just because you want me to think perfectly of this game!  Well first of all i wanna say i dont have much to say other than this game is amazing i have played it my entire life but not the steam version a pirated version and please dont hate me for that but the most stable version of this game is pirate version wanna know the reasons why? ok fine here they are: 1.CL_flushentitypacket error which is extremely annoying given the fact that it will lagg you out and it cant be fixed because most of the servers are against the fix and usually that fix doesnt even work. While that error occurs on pirated version too it occurs really rarely while on steam version it doesnt stop the whole damn game and it is either the server that will kick you for using that fix or VAC that will kick you if you are lucky and ban you and you arent even using the third party software!!! its a console FLIPPING COMMAND!!! 2.There are a ton of servers that have a virus that will rebind all of your keys to join their server once you join the server for the first time and honestly i dont know how will this benefit either the owner of the server or you because you cant even play the server normally you will just reconnect all over again when you try to do something and in all honesty if you do such thing on your server ♥♥♥♥ you and i hope you get cancer. But you might be thinking how is this connected to not buying this game? well simple and i have 2 reasons for that. First reason is that why do you want to spend money on a game that has this type of issue and second of all the reason why this is a biggie is that in pirated version of the game you can change your binds and it will all save but unlike the steam version the 'Synchronizing feature' will save stuff but if you change the binds it will come back because people who use this exploit can work their way around it and trust me you will encounter a lot of servers like that. But trust me i dont hate this game in fact this is the game that got me into pc gaming back in 2004 but is it worth it buying a game that doesnt benefit you in any way as a legal version? of course not but its not me thinking that this game is ♥♥♥♥ in fact its evolutionary its perfect and i have spent 1000+ hours outside of steam version and i gotta say i have been getting a lot less errors and a lot less ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t messages from vac for me trying to fix this error and a lot less problems than i had with the LEGAL VERSION THAT SHOULD BE MORE OF A QUALITY THAN THE ILLEGAL VERSION!. And im not promoting piracy in fact i think its lame but this is the game that should be pirated because it doesnt offer anything good in legal version in fact it downgrades a lot but when there are 50000 people that are hidden off your charts of cs 1.6 just because they wanna play normally and pirate the game there is something seriously wrong with the legal version and i really dont recommend buying this its the same as the pirated version but with more game breaking stuff! ,-1,1

I highly suggest one passes by this out of date game, as classic as it may be. I compare an exaggeration of the experience for a new player to that of being anally entered, spontaneously, by barbed nethers. Overwhelming, painful, and a strong sense of defenselessness.  One would do well to instead spend their time playing the latest, 'sexiest' version, anyway. After all, the gameplay is an evolution on the one this game has to offer.

10,Counter-Strike,"Counter-Strike, this one also known as Counter-Strike 1.6, is a team-based multiplayer realistical/military shooter. And a very well known one at that. It was first available as a free mod for Half-Life 1, being patched regulary up to version 1.6, until recently it got it's way onto Steam, as a serapately sold title.  So, how is the player base? Counter-strike 1.6, being popular self, has an active player base. You will see many servers, up to 32 players. At very least there are many Russian servers, as it had a cult following over there, can't really see past them. On bad side, most seems to prefer 'Terrorist plant C4' mode and then De_Dust2 is the most played map. A lot of servers run small mods, that may alter balance or other small things. And most of it, playerbase had a lot of time to play and master this game, so new players will be more frustated than having fun learning.  Counter-Strike is a very well known realistical FPS. It gained it's popularity while being free mod for popular Half-Life, because it provided something else what wasn't overused yet - realistical shootouts (using models of real weapons, you know) in team multiplayer. Unforgiving and furious. Or unbalanced and twitchy one-shot kills with headshots. Whichever one you prefer.   Counter-Strike has two types of map. First, 'de', is a mode where counter-terrorists have do defends few market spots on map from terrorist. One of the terrorists spawns with C4 in inventrory and has to bring it to one of the marked spots to plant it adn start to countdown of T's victory. Roles change as Terrorists will have now to defend this place from CTs, who's aim now are to defuse the bomb, in which case CTs will win the round, no matter how many more Ts are left. Pretty interesting mode and most played, otherwise this game would have been camping fest. And if one site is too well defended, Ts can go to another one. And then there is a second type, 'cs', in which CTs have to to rescue hostages by bringing them back to base. The problem there, is that hostage NPCs aren't perfect (though good enough) and since CTs have to rescue them all, Terrorist can camp in one of the spots around them, since CTs will have no choice but to come to win. Much less played and even if it does, it goes like your everyday Team Deathmatch, just killing all of opposite team. Much simpler anyway.  Now, the core gameplay... There are few rounds. Each round starts with each team spawning on their side of map. There is no respawning during round, once person is dead he is out, so you will have to worry much more about getting insta-killed. There are no items placed on map itself either (on correct, official maps), no kind of medikits. In spawn place, you have 15 seconds to press 'b' button (or whichever you set) to bring up 'buy menu', where you purchase weapons and equipment for the round witht he money that you earned so far. Yep, when round ends everybody gets some sum of money to spend, with winning team getting more, an ingenius design decision that helps losing team to get steamrolled even harder. What you can buy there is a pistol, primary weapon and any of the equipment. (Yep, if it doesn't smell like prototype of modern military shooters) Once past purchase screen, you are free to run and shoot. And here comes the art of recoil and aiming. For you see, one of the more important thing that is used in this game is accuaricy of your weapon. If you move it drops. if you jump, it drops. It drops while you are shooting too. Thus it becomes more importanly to get good position, making assaults more compilated, and you often have to relearn to shoot, making few clicks instead of just holding down mouse button. You will have to be often walking instead of running, to keep accuaricy while moving (it also makes you silent, so do it often), or just stand and crouch sometimes. Burst shooting is better there and for long range targets you want to be just click few times. Another important thing is that you can shoot through some walls with more powerful primary weapons. So don't be surprised for people shooting through door, walls and even just over the corner, it indeed does small damage to whoever is behind. The game also emphasises aiming because it supports headshots and they do a MASSIVE damage. And you also got three kinds of grenades. Explosive (HE), which explodes, good for throwing into chokepoints. Flashbang, which blinds whoever looked at it when it blows for few seconds, quite annoying but good for stroming into room. And Smoke Grenade, when you don't want enemies to see you coming and don't want to be under direct fire, good for open spaces with snipers (who instakill you when you peek around corner). Protip: You run slightly faster with knife out.  And well, while on theory it sounds interesting, as well as empashises teamwork. here comes the downfall of the game. The weapons, while make people with gun fetish happy, are badly balanced around each other. There are just best and bad weapons. From pistols Desert Eagle is the best, they behave as backup when you got no time to reload primary weapon. Shotguns are theorically good for close range but in this game they are useless and Assault Rifles can kill even better at close range. Sub-Machine Guns category had advantage of no accuaricy drops while moving, but are still inferior to Rifles. Rifles category has two best guns: all-range assault rifle like AK-47 and all-range sniper rifle like AWP (which doesn't even require headshot to one-hit kill), exactly what majority of people use. The only Machine Gun is 'pew pew pew can't hit'. And all-range is all-range, random is random. You may run and shoot in general direction of enemy and pull off a headshot from your AK-47 by luck. Or you may walk around corner, thinking of your next grandious tactical plan, just to get headshotted in insta-second by guy with sniper rifle from close range. It's just so full of cheap and frustating, the rage is probably the main thing that keeps players coming back for more, not honest fun, as well as luck of possibly pulling few magical headshots. Slow-down when being hit doesn't seem to be good idea either, making it harder to get away from the choke points. And random spread is not actually random, it just randomly follows one of the pre-set pattern. And yes, if you will learn them, you will be able to control your shooting better and get on top. Exactly what puts apart newbiews and elites, and exactly what elites seem to boast about when they want to say that Counter-Strike 1.6 is the best because it takes more skills and time to learn, with artifical challenges like this one that makes little sense. And well, once you spend your time to learn them, you will still find out on top that it didn't make the game any more amazing.  But you know, it's not too bad. It does teamwork well. Sometimes the game just works. When you work along the team, round the corners and storming the next room, where you follow teammates, supporting each other. Provide covering fire to the corner. When upon entering next place, each one covers his own direction, as some of the rooms just have too many places from which enemies can shoot you (smoke grenade and flashbangs help in these cases). And it's pretty damn nice at those moments, until they get ruined by something stupid, something you don't feel like could be prevented. Yea, getting shot by sniper.  And yes, this game has good enough sounds. No music, sadly. The graphics are quite HL1 high-definition era, but otherwise are fine enough. The levels are a bit of bland though.  Can't really recommend it. Because everybody who will like such games are already playing it. And player base of this game had too much time by now, that they will be just way too skilled for new players, who will just get destroyed and it will take a long time to get onto same level. It's not like there aren't enough military/realistical shooters anyway.",-1,1

If you were to compare the game to CS:S or CS:GO you would realize how inferior it really is to the two. You might say that CS:GO turned crap once Valve added cases and payed cosmetics, and in turn that makes CS 1.6 better than CS:GO. To that I say CS:GO has better graphics (no surprise) and better controls, if it's the payed skins that turn you away from the game then just don't buy skins/cases/keys.

10,Counter-Strike,"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is the current iteration of Valve’s top-in-class competitive shooter, and the first to be maintained in the very modern way it has been. Learning from its experience with Team Fortress 2, Valve has a miniature economy in CS: GO that revolves entirely around gun decals. Players get a few ‘drops’ a week after matches, which can be a gun decal or a weapon crate – the latter of which cost £1.49 to unlock with a one-use key from the store. Obviously this economy is tailor-made, and so there are extraordinarily rare and mysteriously fantastic-looking gun and knife skins (with prices in the hundreds of pounds), then a large range of other skins tapering down to the common-as-muck variety that trades for pennies.  I don’t pay much attention to the CS: GO economy as a whole, though it’s interesting enough, but it’s important for a non-player to understand that a big chunk of the game’s audience takes it very seriously indeed. In the days after a new Operation launches countless forum threads are launched about the value of the new goods, whether someone should sell this new rare drop they got or hold it for a while, Twitch streams with giveaways and 50 crates being unlocked and so on. You get the picture.    I give such context on CS: GO’s economy because – even though it is a subsidiary part of the game to many including myself – it is the molten core of Operation Vanguard. CS: GO is a regularly-patched game but the major updates come in the form of Operations that introduce new maps and new skins, at the price of around £3 for an access pass – with the nice touch that maps are available to all players regardless, or made so shortly afterwards.  To give an exhaustive history of Operations would be no more useful than a general overview. If you play Counter-Strike then the chances are you play a lot of Counter-Strike. What the Operations do is freshen things up a bit – naturally they don’t disrupt the regular Dust-Mirage-Inferno cycle of competitive play, but you get some unfamiliar environments to tool about in, the chance to score some fancy new weapons, and in the context of a game you play almost daily, £3 a few times a year is chicken feed.  Operation Vanguard is different, and the changes are not for the better. The first problem I have with it is major: the way it’s sold seems to skirt the borderline of deception. To participate in Operation Breakout you bought an ‘All-Access Pass’ for £2.39. To participate in Operation Vanguard I bought an ‘Access Pass’ for £2.39. The difference is obvious side-by-side, but of course when OV popped up in Counter-Strike’s home menu I bought it more or less instantly, thinking this was the same thing.  OV’s selling point is two ‘campaigns,’ a series of missions with three branching paths. The missions are things like ‘Win 16 rounds on map X’ and ‘Kill 20 chickens in Deathmatch mode,’ and completing one bags a pre-determined award – either a weapon crate or a random weapon from a specified collection. So far, so OK. But in fact OV has two more campaigns, both of which cost £1.79 to access – which follow more or less the same pattern.    To be crystal-clear about this, the money is not the problem. I’m happy to pay for Operations, and OV’s combined total of around £6 in the context of the time I put into Counter-Strike is really not an issue. But that switch from ‘All-Access Pass’ to ‘Access Pass (with the right to buy more access)’, just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me right off.  First of all I felt conned. I bought the OV pass in the same way I’d bought all the previous Operation passes, expected it to be the same deal, and realised I’d been fooled by the removal of ‘All.’ Secondly, what the two ‘extra’ purchases offer is basically a re-skinned version of OV’s mission book. But thirdly, and this is the real killer, you’re encouraged to buy them to self-medicate the most egregious, enormous, climactically wrong and frankly offensive design decision in Vanguard.  There are multi-day cooldowns on missions. That’s right Rambo, you may have thought you were buying another set of missions and drops to liven up day-to-day business in CS: GO, but in fact Vanguard is a campaign designed to play out over a set period of time, with the only limiting factor a bald external one: cooldown timers.  Let me set the scene for you. I love Counter-Strike. I saw Vanguard was out on a Thursday, and cleared Friday night. Got in a few beers. Booted it up and bought the pass. I played the first mission, cleared it in about 15 minutes. Chose a second, the killing chickens one, and that was another 15 mins. So around half an hour into my evening of joy I was given a four-day cooldown for the next mission.    You can slice this any way you want, but it’s ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. The sad thing is I get the thought process behind it. Consider: you’re Valve, in charge of a game where players (a) want new content but (b) put in so many hours that they’ll rush through anything almost instantly. For example, mission chains. Operation Breakout introduced missions in the form of random drops, which parcelled them out over time but had no larger arc. It was fine but the missions never felt… important. So Operation Vanguard’s missions are in structured patterns, with defined rewards, and are given the desired longevity through simple brute force of timing. You will not complete this content before we say so, because you can’t.  Oh, except that if you buy the extra mission packs, your cooldowns decrease across the board, because now you’re allowed to do more missions in a set period. That’s right. You’re basically paying to reduce cooldowns. In a Valve game.  The thing is that Operation Vanguard is only a ‘campaign’ in the same way that a pile of biscuits is ‘lunch.’ The missions are basic objectives like ‘Win 16 competitive rounds on Season’ or ‘Get 100 FAMAS kills in Deathmatch mode.’ And what do you get for completing them? Either a drop from an existing collection of guns, with a minor chance of a rare gun, or a weapon crate. The first is fair enough, but the second… I mean, at this point I already felt pretty rinsed by Operation Vanguard, and now it’s ‘rewarding’ me with crates that I need to pay more money to open.    There is a school of thought that says Valve has done this in order that a flood of new crates and mission rewards doesn’t flood the in-game economy, instead trickling them in over the coming months. To that argument the only appropriate response is – who cares? I play Counter-Strike: GO because it’s a great game, I don’t play it because of the economy, and while I accept the latter is how Valve makes money, the moment it starts intruding into the game – if indeed this explanation holds water – then the economy is not acting in the way that it should. That is, it should be improving the experience rather than throttling it.  The sad thing is that Operation Vanguard comes with my favourite selection of community maps yet, including two in Season and Back Alley that feel like potential classics. Yeah they’re all over the place in terms of favouring one side or the other, but this is par for the course with CS: GO and will be tweaked over the coming months. Every CS: GO operation freshens the game up with some new environments if nothing else, and the point of Operation Vanguard’s structure is to elongate this beyond a few days – to really showcase these excellent maps by forcing people to play on them semi-regularly for missions. It at least manages this.  I want to emphasise that I’m an enormous fan and c",-1,0

10,Counter-Strike,"I first played Counter-Strike back in 1999, when it was still just a mod. I went to it on a daily basis, for several hours, as my main source of entertainment and gathering of friends until about 2002, when other activities came along. I only went back to it now, in 2012. This unveiled the greatest disappointment and proof of destruction of a game I have ever experienced. As it is today, this is not Counter-Strike. It is a broken, unrecognizable, nearly useless form of the original game. Valve has let this game rot to death and still make an easy profit for nothing. The server browser is a joke. It is simply broken. The results it returns are completely inaccurate and all servers you will find are run by non-Steam users, with the game settings altered to who knows what, and 90% of them playing the Dust map. The other servers are running non-official maps and pointless game modes. In addition, you can not set your client to disallow the automatic download of custom server sounds or other trash that is force-fed through your connection to alter the game. Counter-Strike has been so blatantly abandoned, that it is shocking Valve still charges something for it. You will also see advertisements while you are connecting to the servers, and while you wait for the next round once you have been killed. Counter-Strike is the epitome of falling from grace and becoming an outright failure. It has become an embarrassment and a gaming tragedy.  Counter-Strike is bad.",-1,1

10,Counter-Strike,"This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I don't remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games.  I am glad that I lived through the golden era of shooters and if I'd have to rate it, it'd 10/10 ofcourse,",1,0

10,Counter-Strike,"Welcome to the world’s most fun over rated pile of ♥♥♥♥.   Since I first got a PC nearly 3 years ago all I have ever heard is counter strike, counter strike, counter strike. And, after about 15 hours of play time I see why.   Right away I can see that when counter strike came out it was the magnum opus of the fps/multiplayer genre and I can respect that but that also explains the largest problem with counter strike, its nonexistent learning curve. For the first maybe 3 hours I played on a few different servers and never killed a single person. I figured I’m new to this and it seems as thoe these guys/girls have been playing much longer than I have been so I began to brush it off and then 2 hours and may servers later I had killed maybe 6 people, not much had changed. And then remembered that that’s stupid, I shouldn’t be playing against people that have 150 hours clocked while I have 5.  Another problem is the weapons  I can understand the weird names, Valve would have been a smaller company then and saved a buck by naming them weird stuff but that doesn’t mean I won’t still make fun of them. The damaged ratio is also complete ♥♥♥♥♥. The sniper rifle is a one hit kill the subs are useless and I was once hit across the map with a shot gun blast. The knife is a bit under powered but Thats better than it being a light saber. And For some reason the only guns that are ever used are the AK look alike the M16 look alike and the sniper rifle.   I should say that counter strike is not a bad a game. It's for sure a sextillion times better than any Call of Duty ever made. And I will confess that this game is more fun giving your friends ADHD kid a gram of cocaine and telling him his dad is made of candy. But it’s also as frustrating as trying to put that same kid in a car seat. ",1,0

But once you do it opens you up to a whole new world of wonders. This game gets a 10/10. The only games that compete are other version of counter-strike, Team Fortress Classic, and Day of Defeat. I would give it an 11/10 but there are no killstreaks.",1,0

10,Counter-Strike,This is such a great MMOPG. You can play it if you keep getting wiped out in Half Life &amp; Half Life 2. Though it would be better to get Counter Strike: Source because it has the same maps as the original and has completely better graphics based on the Half Life 2 Source Engine.,1,0
10,Counter-Strike,I played this game when it was just a third party mod for half life. I cant tell you how many hours of my life I spent fragging my friends. It is still my old standby and even though steam took it over eventually they preserved its life for an online game. I recommend you play the classic whenever you get a feeling for nostalgia.,1,0

Although the graphics are now considered quite dated, it somehow doesn't change the appeal and visual accessibility of the game itself. Perhaps newer gamers and people trying it out for the first time in today's gaming world will never develop a bond that veteran CS players will forever cherish with the old school counter-strike, but for us, this game will always be the go-to first person shooter and will endure as the trend-setting sage of all future shooting games to come. Rivaled only by the likes of the Battlefield series (though obviously not comparable as they are essentially different games albeit being first-person shooters both), counter-strike is an absolute treasure and for the pennies you could snatch it for, it is definitely worth your while as well.

When developers of this game genre learn that this 2 things are the most inportant for good FPS, they will make a game as good as CS 1.6 is... CS:GO does not have these major aspects, and doesn't deserve name of Counter-Strike (IMO). As a third very important thing for FPS game, I would say the animations... The animations of player models such as runnig, walking, crouching, gun holding/fireing/reloading etc... Graphics isn't so important, doesn't need to be sooo good, but decent due to visibility...",1,0

10,Counter-Strike,"The classic shooter upgraded with modern controls: Counter-Strike was something unseen, yet highly needed in the late 90's and early 00's. It carried with it the idea that you didn't need a single player 'story mode' to make ripples in the video game industry. As future competitors would attempt to reflect, all CS needed was an incredible skill-based gameplay with a start-of-the-art ability to play against players from around the world. Toss in some alternate gameplay styles to help break up the chance of monotonous moments and throw it all over a large assortment of levels for good measure; you’ll end up with a dish that, for years, has been best served with a dedicated server and a good group of friends. It's no wonder that CS gave birth to some of the best online team play the world has ever seen and continues in that tradition to this day.

When it came out it was really good and enough, then the game never grew up and we never had patchs / new versions. But it was still fine as long as we could all developpe our skill and create new strats.  We got a lot of mods like zombie deathmatch gungame jail and for me the best mods Hide'N'Seek, Kz, Deathrun etc...  To be honest those years were truly a pleasure to play.

10,Counter-Strike,"The developers of the Half-Life Mod, Counter-Strike really knew what they were doing when they said they wanted to construct a mod like no other. It was, like Half-Life, something new for the public to lay their bored eyes on. There never before was a mod about Terrorism vs Counter Terrorism, and thanks to the two developers of the game, it happened. Why Terorrism vs Counter Terrorism though? It was only something new and that is it. It was something to literally 'wow' the public with intense competitive multiplayer gameplay. It was something people actually payed attention to and thought it off as a sport. So fourth, this mod has been recognized so much that more installments have appeared, and that is an amazing thing for a game that once started off as a mod. Just like Team Fortress and how that continued on into Team Fortress 2. I have yet to play Global Offensive but I will do that some time in the future.  Its games like these that always amaze me with their originality. And I believe Counter-Strike is one of those games that deserves to be noticed and introduced to FPS fans across the world.

Until playing CSGO I was still very into the game. After playing CSGO for few months I tried playing CS 1.6 again, but the graphics and shooting mechanics are just awful at this point, it just doesn't hold up.

10,Counter-Strike,"Death is a great teacher. Failure in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better.  Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you’re a Call of Duty player, you’re going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what it’s always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years.  For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues.  Pieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route.  Even in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive doesn’t care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crouching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machine-gun fire.  Consequently, killing in Global Offensive feels good. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. It's also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players aren't watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, they're more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when you're getting steamrolled by an obviously better team.  If you've played Counter-Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike. Like Counter-Strike: Source before it, Global Offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter, while doing little to disrupt the core form and function. At the same time, it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort.  Fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables. Molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction. Flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic, too. They're particularly useful during Demolition matches, which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between. The new and modified maps in this mode aren't as big as classic Counter-Strike arenas – entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location – but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever. The Lake map is a standout -- there's a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site, which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots. To separate Demolition from Defusal, players can't buy between rounds. Instead, it takes a cue from the other new mode, Arms Race, in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly. The better you do, the more you have to switch up the way you play, and because Demolition is so fast you'll need to be quick on your feet.  Unlike other game types, Arms Race allows for respawns. It's the most chaotic and care-free mode in Global Offensive, with players throwing caution to the wind for the sake of climbing the kill ladder as quickly as possible. It's a shame there are only two maps in Arms Race -- a problem that will more likely persist on consoles than PC.  If you have the option, playing the PC version is unquestionably the best way to experience Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Mods, mouse and keyboard, and the usual PC-only options are better than the ports. Plus, Valve is much better about long-term PC support -- it abandoned Team Fortress 2 on consoles, and Portal 2's level editor was PC exclusive. If you prefer to play on consoles, Global Offensive is the same great game.",1,0

And during Beta Version 4 (B-V4) Valve became interested in the game that was being developed, hired the developers for valve to help make it better, and in a few years the original developers quit making the game and let Valve take control of it. If you like the classic First Person Shooters from around 1995-2002 this is basically the game for you. Also you can shoot through almost every wall with every gun in the game.

10,Counter-Strike,"This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I don't remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.

10,Counter-Strike,"This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I don't remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.  I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games.  I am glad that I lived through the golden era of shooters and if I'd have to rate it, it'd 10/10 ofcourse,",1,0

My mother said to me: 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.' I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette.

And the whirlpool of regret washes over you as dusk turns to dawn and you realize that you didn't study for your freakin' biology exam. For shame. Too bad this box isn't large enough to contain my stories of grand LAN parties. Needless to say, this was an amazing game.  Though after years passing, the humor lies in sadness that the same 13 year olds that I left behind are still playing.. Worse yet, they're being domineered by server admins who are exactly 1 year older! (I figure a bedtime extension merits you the ability to ban &amp; kick players).

10,Counter-Strike,"Wow.  This is a game I grew up with and it's one of the most popular online first-person-shooters out there, or atleast; it used to be. The game was everywhere, and it had its reasons to. This was the game that was seen on the computer screens of the LAN parties, tournaments and other major computer related events.  It's action-packed, skill-based and it had a huge following. Even today you may find lots of server filled with players. The gameplay surrounds around you and your team. If you play the 'DE maps' you're a terrorist, you must plant the bomb and make sure that the CT's won't defuse it and if you're in the CT team, you must defuse the bomb before it goes off. If you play the 'CS maps' you must rescue the hostages as a CT and if you're on the terrorist team you must keep the hostages held-up and eliminate any CT that tries to stop you. Any round can also be won by eliminating the opponents.  This game spawned a franchise and will always be remembered as one of the starting grounds of multiplayer, teambased first-person-shooters.  The game is from 2000 and is outdated by its succesor; Global Offensive. But if you're into old games, you should check this out but I highly doubt you haven't heard of this game before.",1,0

10,Counter-Strike,"This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I don't remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.  I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games.  I am glad that I lived through the golden era of shooters and if I'd have to rate it, it'd 10/10 ofcourse,",1,0

Yes ... almost all FPS are based on teamwork. But Counter Strike 1.6 is special, you play just for play (no rewards), here you can improve your teamwork to play other games, for example! Or you can simply kill players with no reason... The community have already sent some funny mods for this game and it's currently running in some servers you can join (Zombie Mode, Deathrun, Jailbreak,...). Repetitive? Well it depends on you, if you play all time in the same map in same gamemode, of course is repetitive, but if you make pcw(team/clan war) with your friends in alternated maps, the game will never be repetitive.",1,0

Oh yeah but just add functional bots so I dont have to download ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Z-Bots, which, are not realistic in any way possible (aimbot, movement patterns, staring contests with enemies).  Although the game is a classic representation of how modernized tactical shooters should be produced, the hackers are always going to be there to ruin the fun. Also, some seriously dysfunctional hit detection occurs during most matches. Also, not trying to be too judgemental, but the game would have been a lot easier to play if the crosshairs had center dots. I say this because Source and G.O. have center crosshair dots, which make aiming much more persistent.   ***8.5/10***  Final Statement:  It's a damn ugly game, but that's what makes it good. Once modded, it can look like it runs on a completely different engine. However, the detail and missing physics are not present due to the limitations of GoldSrc's dated capabilities. Oh, and this game does not deserve to be ran with mods. Just simple and complex retextures of the weapons provided within the game. I would like to tell you that this game is better than Source and G.O., but half the community sticks to the newer iterations rather than the original.",1,0

10,Counter-Strike,"Hey there! Remember all the good old gaming days? Searching for mix teams, joining up with some random dudes playing all night long? Totally missing some school days here and there? Then you probably, like me, played this game countless of hours.    You know all the default maps better than your first name and have surely tested out thousands of custom maps, hundreds of aim-maps, hundreds of KZ/jumping maps, Warcraft 3 mod (a mod to a game that was a mod, how ironic?), Zombie-mod, gungame mod, evenly and evilly slaughtered all your friends in deathmatch, met thousands of players from all around the world, even from Africa and pwned unimaginable amounts of hardcore and noob-players.    This game will absolutely never die, players will keep trying to find and therefor create new servers and the old PCW/mix-games are still going to be played in the silent even though the competetive gaming scene has gone over to CS:GO. And thank you scene for doing that. This game really needs the cult status in the shadow of newer and more refreshing games. Let it still be there, reminding newer generation of players how the good old times were. Let all the videos be there on youtube especially of the bigger contests. It makes me happy.   So, what is this game all about?  Well, it is simple. The main theme of the game is either 'bomb-planting terrorists vs bomb-defusing counter-terrorists', 'hostage-rescue-mode' or 'save the VIP-mode'. A competetive first person shooter game that has immersive action-packed gameplay all over your screen. You will most likely be flashed, smoked out, shot from far away by a sniper, spawnkilled by your sister, knifed by your brother, exploded by either a bomb or a thrown HE-granade or camped to death by a noob. Sounds good? Then join in the action! You are not just late, you are very late!",1,0

I enjoyed AS_ maps like oilrig, arctic, and various other maps that are no longer in the 'mainstream cs:go scene'.  10/10 - Sometimes I play this to remember the good times.

If you don't know what this game is, you should probably slap yourself and stop playing games because this ♥♥♥♥ literally founded multiplayer first-person shooters.  Okay, not 'founded', Quake did that first but it sure as hell helped them develop into what they are today.  While the graphics definitely haven't held up to standards today (kind of obvious since this game was released in ♥♥♥♥ING 2000 AND STARTED DEVELOPMENT IN 1999), this game is still fun. Why? There's a lot more maps in the game, and as a result of low graphical quality, it's a LOT easier to run on old systems or just bad systems in general. And the gameplay is still just as fun as CS:S or even CS:GO.  This game used to still be the 3rd most played game on Steam next to Team Fortress 2 (  ) and Dota 2, but that changed when CS:GO actually started to become a good game back in 2013. Now there's really only the most dedicated CS players that play this game.  I don't recommend going into this game unless you're a dedicated CS veteran who wants to relive the history of CS and see what the first game got everyone hyped for. This game's great, I'm not going to lie, it's just the learning curve as of right now is STEEP. And that can be good or bad for some people.

10,Counter-Strike,"I've played this game since I was around 6 years old back in 2002 and it still makes me laugh and have fun whenever I launch it to this very day. Over 12 years of endless entertainment. No other game on this planet has given me more entertainment and enjoyment than Counter-Strike 1.6 has and I doubt no game ever will.  Reason i've only got 38 hours here is because I no longer use the account I originally played cs 1.6 on.   func_vehicle is what makes this Counter Strike game the best out of all the others in the franchise.  Find a server that has car maps or maps with func_vehicle entities and you will have endless fun running over teammates and enemies in all kinds of hilarious and goofy vehicles not giving a care in the world.  You can drive a fork with a meatball on the end of it. Do i need to say more?  Mods on this game are amazing too. There is a mod where you can catch pokemon, level them up, train them and use their skills. Call of Duty mod that is suprisingly better than cod its self, Warcraft mods, zombie mods, basebuilder and so on...  There is even a map for the jailbreak gamemode that has driveable snowmobiles.   1337/10",1,0

10,Counter-Strike,"First of all, let me start by saying this game used to be my religion 10 years ago, so I am probably biased.  So many years after its inception, the graphics for Counter-Strike do look pretty dated. of Compared to the quality standards of most of today's shooters, the original Counter-Strike (and likely its predecessors, which very much live in the same vein) may feel a bit rough, unpolished or even at times a bit corny (hostage sounds :p). Still, at it's core, the game is a fast-paced, trigger-reflex shooter.  Edit: I forgot to also include that you can use 'high definition' skins, textures and remodels for pretty much all assets in the game, so the game does have some degree of leeway and customization visually. Back in the day that was one of the things that made this game the bees knees for me. Swapped out my in-game AUG with the model and txt information an LA80, hell yeah! Not a fan of desert eagles? How does a .44 magnum revolver give you the feels? You can also edit the sound files. I remember downloading some sound pack that made Rob Zombie's Dragula play as the round start sound effect and it was almost a month until I finally changed it, to the point where now, 10 years later, I still expect to hear Dragula when I play Counter-strike. These are the things that make me feel nostalgic and think of the late 90s and early 2000; they became iconic for me.   This game is all about making your shots count before the other guy gets his in. Deaths come quickly, wins feel rewarding. The games are split up into objective-based perma-death rounds. If you are a terrorist, you may have to plant a bomb (edgy, I know, but remember how old this game is- concepts came way before 9/11 and the explosion of modern terrorism, etc) and if you found yourself on the Counter-terrorist team, your objective would be to find and secure or disarm the bomb before it's detonated. Each round can also be completed deathmatch style by wiping out the enemy team (indeed, this will usually happen in most cases as each team pushes towards their respective objective)  Occasionally, due to the respectable size and intelligent layout of the maps, there will come situations where there are only one or two players left alive on each team and both teams must aggressively pursue the objective. You've never experienced tension until you have 40 seconds to defuse a bomb and you don't know where the devil who planted it went. You attempt to disarm it while there's still time. You hear footsteps behind you. Your hair trigger reflexes can save you. Will you come out on top?  There are still hundreds, maybe thousands of public Counter strike servers available, and a good number of players to populate them (though many servers are ghost or bot servers also). Most of them (95%) will run some sort of addons and plugins but they install automatically on the fly as needed on your client so you dont have to worry about extra downloads. These addons will range from subtle things that enhance game functions like realtime stats, to comical sound effects (I've heard the 'HEAD SHOT!' callout from Unreal Tournament in CS more than I have from playing any UT game) to absolutely ridiculous and gamechanging, to the leveling Warcraft 3 hero addon where you can get a chain lightning spell XD to being able to deploy a parachute whenever you want to to avoid any fall damage.  It is a bit old, so if that word alone scares you you may want to avoid the original CS (and possibly the newer ones as well, as they play very similarly) but if you enjoyed the Half-Life series (the engine) and you like modern shooters and want to try one with some good pace, try Counter-Strike. Where a game of Call of Duty or the like would typically degenerate into a full on bloodbath where nothing is sacred and everyone is shooting you from behind, Counter Strike has pacing; every round can play out completely different from the last, depending on the tactics used by each team and the route they choose to take towards their objective.   It's far from perfect, but it will always have a special place in my heart. &lt;3  There was a time, when, if you wanted to flashbang your team and hear their cries of anguish, this was pretty much the only game you could do it in.  10/10 for flashbang memories",1,0

If your a person who doesn't mind graphics but likes counter strike I would definitely buy it because, while I don't necessarily like classic on this version all of the custom maps and game modes make well worth ten dollars. *Alert* A lot of the gun names and the amount of guns is pretty different from CS GO but there are probably guides and once you get past your first hour-ish its fine.",1,0

10,Counter-Strike,"The classic that set an entire subgenre of FPS games. I played the beta, and played that for YEARS before buying and installing 1.6. That's when I first got my Steam account. Then I got CS:Source. Then, it was others. Thirty games later, I still love the original CS. I was a member of 76th AD on Day of Defeat, and I regularly hung out on Vir's Pub in Vancouver long after the release of CS:S. There's a reason this game has more hours logged than any other for me (over 1400 hours, at last check); it never gets old. I sometimes have to remember to buy ammo, since CS:S tied ammo to the weapon, but this game was truly my first love in the FPS genre.  Seriously, just get it. It's always good to have the classic. And seriously—I only play CS and CS:S in the series; CS:GO's pay-to-win system is not what I look for in a game. Bide your time, build up your funds, and then unleash the fury. It's that simple. No, I'm not good enough to do pro gaming. I'm not even really good enough to make it on the amateur circuit. But I did get good enough to be an even match to my friends… all without paying for deus ex machina.   I don't play WoW for similar reasons: I refuse to pay a monthly fee to play a game. Yes, there are free (libre) servers out there. My stepson runs one. But the point is that if I buy the license to the game, I should be able to play all I want without having to pay a fee. Pay-to-win is arguably worse than pay-to-play; it creates an unbalanced play experience, and I refuse to participate in that.   Bearing that in mind, that's why I love CS and CS:S. It's just you, your skill, and an adversarial challenge. There's no buying your way to victory. I hope Valve can get back to that in future releases.",1,0

10,Counter-Strike,"This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I don't remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.  I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games.  I am glad that I lived through the golden era of shooters and if I'd have to rate it, it'd 10/10 ofcourse,",1,0

10,Counter-Strike,"In its day, CS 1.6 was the shining example of a multiplayer FPS experience. It was just one of those games that, if you didn't own it, you were just statistically worse than everyone else. Oh, how the might have fallen. Nowadays, the game is plagued with a general lack of interest, as most of its fans have moved on to its vastly superior brothers, CSS and CSGO, and for good reason.  I would recommend playersonly play on servers they trust. This is because apparently one server overwrote all of my unused keys to connect to 'xdd.ms-shadow.ro:27015', which is also a server i would recommend avoiding at all costs.

10,Counter-Strike,I've played this game since I was around 6 years old back in 2002 and it still makes me laugh and have fun whenever I launch it to this very day. Over 12 years of endless entertainment. No other game on this planet has given me more entertainment and enjoyment than Counter-Strike 1.6 has and I doubt no game ever will.  Reason i've only got 38 hours here is because I no longer use the account I originally played cs 1.6 on.   func_vehicle is what makes this Counter Strike game the best out of all the others in the franchise.,1,1
10,Counter-Strike,"Counter-Strike is a multiplayer spin-off game to the Half Life franchise. Set in the same universe except focused on the HECU Marines themselves. There is no plot to this game, it's purpose is to establish a fun co-op multiplayer game that allows gamers to either fight it off or team up around the globe. There is a selection of different locations for the areas and different types of game play to create endless possible features wether you play as the marines or the terrorists is all up to you. This game was so successful it established a large fan base and spawn a few sequals. If you want to play a classic online multiplayer, you can't go more classic than this.

10,Counter-Strike,"The game is perfectly designed and its graphics is incredible. The Counter Strike 1.6 game is specifically designed to offer shear fun and excitement for all young and old generation as well. The game tactics cannot be judged at ease as the targets and tasks change as per the assigned map location inside the game. In this game, the real challenges are like exploiting the opposition, diffusing the bomb, killing enemy with mere knife as a weapon and rescuing the hostages which are trapped at the weird locations. All in all, the tasks assigned in this game are never achievable in a time span of 5 minutes.  In some map of this game, the task is to win the round within 90 seconds which is quite impossible if you are playing the expert level. Also some of the team members don't follow your commands during the game which adds more delay in achieving the tasks. In such situations one has to have the accurate skills to win this game. So it is obvious that this game will take near about 2 months time to complete all the four modes like easy, normal, hard and expert. But if you love this game, and there is proper audio settings present at your machine, then there is no stopping and all modes of this game can be completed within few days or may be in few hours of time. Now in terms of speculation, it is seen that parents worry about their child playing offensive games and counter strike 1.6 is no excuse to this scenario. So children's should keep in mind that playing such games is for fun and they must themselves have control over the time which they devote towards this popular and addictive game.   The game is full of action and I feel that one who plays a counter strike game can perform the tasks like studying and other home related duties at a greater pace. But it is necessary that the gamers spend a lot of time on studying since balance between games and study has to be maintained at any cost. So the students who play this game should take care of home duties and study at first. At last if they find time, they have to invest it while playing this incredible game.",1,0

10,Counter-Strike,"Best game to play if you have a potato. It still is a very fun game despite dated graphics. However, if you have a good computer and can run the newer games, then there isn't much point to playing this one, unless you're like me and enjoy playing older games. The gameplay is rather different from the newer games. For one, this one is much harder. It feels like the first Rainbow Six at times.",1,0
10,Counter-Strike,"Remains an old classic. The mechanics of the movement in this game is simply art. The way that you can gain boost by using a simple technique called 'bhoppin' aka 'bunnyhopping' is just overwhelming amazing.

As said, an old classic, a must have game,  As the old 1.6 player I am, I am proud to say that if you havent played 1.6 you havent played cs. Simple as that.  Go play it until your fingers hurt of 'bhoppin' and spraying.",1,0

That late 90's FPS feel and the gritty nature of a low-budget mod gives the game it's charm.   Some things have not aged well, such as a search bar for server and the lack of customization options for your crosshair; i dunno, maybe I'm just spoiled.   This is probably the most difficult in the series for newcomers to get used to, but once you get the hand of the often clunkey controls and movement, it'll be an enjoyable experience.  ",1,0

10,Counter-Strike,"  The CS1.6 is the successor to Thiel's CS1.5, a denizen of this magazine's 'Recommended Components' listing ever since Sam Tellig enthused over it in August 1994. (He also wrote about it in May '96, while Muse Kastanovich's November '95 review included a full set of measurements.) Like the '1.5, the '1.6 is a floorstanding two-way design with a sloped-back front baffle. That's where the resemblance ends, however, as every other aspect of the 2002 speaker's design is new.  Whereas the CS1.5's baffle was flat, with step-backs for the hefty grille, the '1.6's is elegantly sculpted with a CNC machine to optimize dispersion, the minimal grille fitting into a shallow depression and held with concealed magnets. With the grille removed, the most obvious visible feature is a long vertical slot beneath the woofer, surrounded by a machined flare. This slot acts as the reflex port, but its geometry is claimed to minimize wind noise and any modification of its tuning by the grille.  The 6.5' woofer, designed and manufactured in-house, uses a 3' voice-coil to drive the metal cone closer to its perimeter than usual. This is said to increase the stiffness of the cone, pushing the inevitable breakup modes much higher in frequency than with a conventional cone and voice-coil. The large coil allows the neodymium magnet to be housed completely within the voice-coil former, inherently shielding the magnet. The 1' tweeter uses a metal dome and, like the woofer, features a short coil with a copper distortion-reducing ring, operating in a long gap. The tweeter dome is recessed slightly in a front plate with a short flare, which will increase its on-axis sensitivity to match the efficient woofer, at the expense of restricting the unit's dispersion in the top octave.  The crossover is, as is usual in Thiel's Coherent Source designs, a phase-optimal first-order type. This and the sloping back baffle allow the sounds from both drivers to arrive at the listener's ears at the same time. In a welcome departure from earlier Thiel speakers, the CS1.6's sturdy terminal posts are sited on the rear of its cabinet rather than the base.  Sound  Setting up the CS1.6s involved finding positions for them that gave the optimum balance among four nonrelated aspects of sound quality. The speaker's bass region is intrinsically shelved-down. However, moving the speakers close to the sidewalls to give some boundary reinforcement of the low frequencies also emphasized some residual hardness in the low treble, and resulted in a balance that was too bright with the speakers facing straight ahead. Moving the speakers well away from the sidewalls gave a sound that was clean and clear, but with insufficient bass. Keeping the speakers where they had the most extended bass but toeing them in so that they faced the listening seat reduced the hardness, added some useful top-octave air, and gave a soundstage that was superbly detailed and stable. On the downside, the overall sound was still a little bright for my tastes and system.  Ultimately, I moved each speaker forward along the line joining its acoustic center to the listening position, noting how the drop in bass weight was balanced by a corresponding drop in low-treble hardness. This sounds more straightforward than it was because the CS1.6's overall sound changed more during the break-in process than I am used to. Thiel recommends 50 hours 'at moderately loud levels,' but at the end of the month during which I used the Thiels for my everyday listening, I was still not sure that they'd reached equilibrium.  But what had begun as brightness had been transformed into superb resolution of detail. What had started out as a lightweight, not too well-defined low-frequency register ended up as a balance that worked well on such superb double-bass recordings as Edgar Meyer's new disc of concertos, by himself and Bottesini, with the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra (Sony Classical SK 60956). Meyer's Concerto in D starts with some E-string grumbling and portamento slides, all rendered perfectly clearly on the CS1.6s, without any boom obscuring the instrument's pitch.  ",1,0

10,Counter-Strike,HOW TO PLAY COMPETITIVE IN COUNTER STRIKE 1.6,1,0
10,Counter-Strike,"Ah, the memories..",1,0
10,Counter-Strike,"In a nutshell: 10/10 - Really good game for being what it is, an old classic.  What is Counter-Strike? - This is basically SWAT team simulator 2000, it's a pretty competitive 5v5 FPS shooter where you must stop the terrorists from a range of objectives, such as rescuing hostages, defusing bombs or killing terrorists before they plant their bomb, even escort missions where you must escort a buddy to a helicopter! As terrorists your goal is to well, kill the Counter-Terrorists, to put it bluntly.  Will it Run on my Computer? - Considering my cheap Lenovo G580 with integrated graphics can handle this at 60fps, unless you use a really outdated PC (like, a computer made before 3D games were commonplace) I'm sure your fine.  Parent's Guide - I'd say FPS games are generally a no-no for parents who care about what their children play, and actually, this game, if you go into settings and turn blood off, its actually not too bad, I'd say 13+ is appropriate.  Graphics - (Note: This game was released in 2000, excuse what is terrible graphics nowadays), pretty good graphics, all the characters are in pretty good detail and the guns look nice and pretty realistic-looking.   Gameplay - I will say, it's quite fun, but I will tell you, this is a game meant to be played with friends or meant to be played with players who are good at teamwork, your entire team could lose simply from one player on your team not going with your team's plans.  Is it Worth The Price? - Yes, absolutely, if you want to see where CS:GO started, get it for sure!",1,0

10,Counter-Strike,"The classic. The original. The first and last of its kind. The beginning of a legacy. Or just hours upon hours of time wasted while your brain controversially shouts to you 'Just one more round!'  The excitement of a firefight is a standard of most First-Person Shooters but Counter-Strike is different. The game tries to focus on communication and teamwork coincided with skilled aim and complex maneuvers rather than just free-for-all deathmatch game. Failure to comply with the games train of thought winds you up in the lovely thing we gamers call 'Spectator Mode.' Gotta love that! Although becoming proficient at the game will take a lot longer than most games it is worth the time put into it!   Gamers that are looking for a game that requires teamwork, skill, time, practice, and communication will not be disappointed!

10,Counter-Strike,"Great game! I started with source, and felt that this was going to be a downgrade. After playing for about four minutes, I learned how competitive the game was. I learned I wasn't good at the game, and trained for once. That was something I had never done on Counter-Strike: source.  Now it's time to talk about the bad things: First of all, although there are more servers than TFC has, there is still hardly any servers. You can find a server and join it, but most of the servers have custom maps and free guns. Obviously the graphics are a downgrade, but who plays games for graphics? I sure as hell don't. And for the year 2000 the graphics are great!  There is a misconception with this game where people think that Bunnyhopping is still in the game. It's not. They removed it in 1.4 and it is now 1.6.  Overall, BUY THIS GAME!",1,0

Its a hard game to get a grasp off, but now that you cannot just spray at ones head and get head shots. This game alongside dota, and starcraft.

10,Counter-Strike,"Well I guess since I have 117 hours clocked into this game *cough cough* steam bug *cough cough* I am obligated to write a review for this game. So this game is most definetly timeless as it is basically super smash bros melee to Counter-Strike:Source/Counter-Strike Global Offensive's super smash bros brawl. This game is unique as when you die you don't respawn until the next round meaning that your team can lose by having all of it's members die. As well, you need to buy your weapons or take them from the bodies of your enemies instead of just finding them scattered across the battlefield like other games of it's time did. Today the game can seem a bit outdated with a lack of ragdoll physics making aerial deaths look weird and unnatural as well as the obvious outdated graphics which can be 'fixed' with a hd patch that just looks weird and unnatural compaired to games made at the time of the patch's creation (2003). Overall I would recommend this game if you buy the retail copy or if they fixed the bug that is the only reason why I have logged 117 hours into the game.",1,0

10,Counter-Strike,"This is Counter-Strike 1.6, the latest version of the original Counter-Strike. The graphics are far inferior to the source version but the gameplay is considered better by most Counter-Strike veterans. This has some maps not found in the source verison and has the riot shield which is not in the source version either. The riot shield allows you to avoid bullets but you cannot have a primary weapon if you have it equiped so you can only use your sidearm. This version also features a gamemode not available in the source version. The gamemode is where you must protect a player controlling a VIP while they make their way to the rescue vehicle. If you want to see how different this is from the source version then go right ahead, it's only $5.00 on steam so you have nothing to lose.",1,0

While CS: GO is my personal favorite, CS 1.6 is still damn fun, and given that it's an older game, you can play it on literally anything nowadays. There's a single-player mode with bots, perfect for newbies or lone wolves, but make sure you've practiced before hopping online, or you'll get destroyed. tl;dr you can't go wrong with this game.",1,0

Even coming back to the game after not being able to play for years I still find the fun that i had in the very beginning.

10,Counter-Strike,"Gameplay: 10/10 LAN Fun: 3/3  Good Servers: 2/7  Counter-Strike, perhaps the most competitive game of it's time, hasn't aged well graphics-wise, but the gameplay remains more precise and consistent than most FPS games today. This game is a  great  LAN game for get-togethers, but otherwise you may have come too late on perhaps one of the greatest games of all time. Servers that I have connected to show that I have horrible ping, and the lag assures me of that. I have come across a server or two that I can connect to and enjoy, as well as being vanilla-CS, considering all the servers that mainly run modded games (which is about 4/5 of the servers). So here are the reasons to buy the original Counter-Strike:   Pros  -Can run on a potato -Plays smoothly no matter the settings. (However, you can connect to a server somewhere in Latin America or the Middle East, and lag like heck.) -Great fun to play with friends, as it can get really competitive, but at the same time your friends may not have this ancient gem, so this is dependent on the situation. -Solid gameplay. Nothing else really compares to the precision that went into it over the years. -Large map selection, as well as custom-maps found all over the internet. -Mods, but many are not as good as some of the others. You have to dig through garbage to find the fun ones.   Cons  -Very few good servers -Hard to convince people that don't already know how great this game is to buy it, considering it's more than a decade old. -So...many...sound...file...downloads...from...servers... -Custom maps are very rarely as balanced as maps packed in with the game.   Verdict  If you've got the money, and are curious as to what this legendary game is like, then it wouldn't be a complete waste, but if you are coming here from the latest CS or CoD or Battlefield, without having played other older FPS games, then you might regret the buy because this is a game that is quite outdated in terms of UI and such, and might not be appealing.  Overall 7/10 now, after more than a decade since release.",1,0

10,Counter-Strike,"Counter Strike is a classic game. Fun, addictive, and customizable. It's incredibly easy to mod, texture and map for so you could expect a whole lotta mods.  Pros: -Great gameplay, bit of a learning curve but it'll become second instinct soon enough -Servers are still up, even for such an old game it still has a whole crap-ton of servers.  -Modding community is GREAT -Cheap, as in really freakin cheap, not indie game cheap, but still very cheap Cons -Most people who you will play with have been playing for longer than I have been alive. Expect to get pwned very very often -Netcode is a ♥♥♥♥♥, adjusting settings using the console takes a hell of a while -People are sometimes way too serious when playing -For Graphics junkies: Graphics are pretty damn old-looking (what the hell do you expect it's GoldSrc)  While it's not a perfect game it still provided me with tons of fun and I love playing it. It's a bit slower than CSGO and the weapons behave differently.

10,Counter-Strike,"This is an interesting game. It is incredibly difficult to rate it either 'yes' or 'no.' There are far too many points to consider. Counter-Strike was released nearly fourteen years ago, yet it is still difficult to find an open server. It is incredibly fun and can make you laugh or tear your hair out. This game can be excellent for fans of strategy games and shooters, but it's very rare to be able to enjoy it fully. Unless you play on competitive servers, most everyone goes 'rogue' and does not work as a team. There are frequent cheaters using programs to increase movement speed, look through walls, or assist in aiming. If you look through the community page, many of the posts are pictures of cats or pornography. When joining a new game, you always feel paranoid about what the server is downloading. The community can be very scary; you must play on servers you trust with people you respect. If you can do this, you will have a blast. Counter-Strike is still played by a huge number of people; you can find great servers with great communities in nearly every language imaginable. There's a wide variety of weapons to choose from, and it is simple to get in on the action. There are no pay-to-win or customization features—only action. Counter-Strike can be a fantastic game if you know how to use it properly.  Things to note: • There are no bots in CS. However, the Counter-Strike: Condition Zero package (probably the best way to purchase the game) includes Condition Zero, which has support for bots and can be played without an Internet connection. • This is not 1.6 (to my knowledge); there are no shields and a few things are different (the difference is negligible). However, Counter-Strike: Condition Zero still has these features. • This is considered a mod for Half-Life. However, it can be downloaded independently. Note that Counter-Strike will be saved inside the 'Half-Life' folder on your computer.",1,0

10,Counter-Strike,"This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I don't remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.  I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games.  I am glad that I lived through the golden era of shooters and if I'd have to rate it, it'd 10/10 ofcourse,",1,0

10,Counter-Strike,This game is a genuine classic. Grew up with it. Got over 600 hours on it. Loved almost every moment of it (except when I got killed by aim-bot and wallers) but oterwise a great buy. It has its perks and like a trillion mods of which I'd say 25% are running at any given time from servers worldwide. Definitely recommend it to players who like oldschool games.,1,0

10,Counter-Strike,"This is by far one of the most fun online shooters ever. If not the best ever made, And in my opinion the game that pretty much started the genre. Ive been playing the game off and on since it's release and still to this day it never gets old. The game runs really good on modern pc's and it's really a game that when your doing good you really feel a sense of accomplishment. Plenty of fun maps to play on, plenty of servers to play on, plenty of customization options. This is one game that you can really taylor to suit your style. Plenty of user created skins for your weapons that can really make this game look amazing. And I still prefer counter strike over counter strike source. I don't know, call it nostalgia or whatever but there really is something about just good ol' counter strike 1.6 that is just simply magical. It truley is a classic in every sense of the word. And STILL is just as enjoyable (if not more enjoyable) then any online shooter on the market today. So glad I got to grow up with this game. I would definitley recommend it to any fan of competitive online first person shooters. Come Join the fun.",1,0

It is not as old as Wolfenstein and does not have beastly graphics like Battlefield but CS 1.6 did not need those aspects to have a special place amongst all games.

It can be enjoyed anywhere with the 64MB portable version for LAN parties.

10,Counter-Strike,"Never before has a multiplayer game blended all the elements of true competition and sweat-soaked-shirt anxiety as well a Counter-Strike (CS). You probably already know CS as one of the most popular modifications for Half-Life. It's been available for download for over a year, at least in beta form. But unless you've got a super fast Internet connection at your house, you may not have played it yet as the nearly 100 megabyte download may be daunting for those of you not fortunate enough to have a high-speed connection. Thankfully CS has turned into a full-blown retail game and, while the two versions of CS are identical, it certainly worth shelling out $30 for this stellar title...plus you get a few more multiplayer goodies in the retail package to boot.   Let me start off by saying that the Counter-Strike pack is a stand-alone product. You don't need the original Half-Life to play this game. In the retail package you get a full version of CS as well as Team Fortress Classic, Opposing Force multiplayer, and the Wanted, Redemption and Firearms mods. The entire pack is overflowing with multiplayer fun, but, of course, the real focus of the retail release is Counter-Strike.   There is a single-player component to CS and, while it provides a good primer, this mod is all about online action. You basically play a game of cat and mouse, with the mouse being a terrorist group and the cat a squad of counter-terrorists. As a terrorist, you're goal is to plant a bomb at a specific location or hold a group of hostages. As a counter-terrorist, it's your duty to defuse said bomb or rescue the ill-fated hostages. Taking out all players on the opposing side will also assure your victory.   CS is an action lover's dream, with games lasting only four or five minutes (if that in some cases) because, unlike Half-Life, one shot to the head can mean instant death. CS is the perfect mix between fast-action and realistic damage. You can't just absorb bullet after bullet and expect to walk away. Working as a team is a must and, while you're in the game, taking the lone wolf approach will often get you killed...and fast.   It's the team-based tactics that make CS so fun. I can't stress how important it is in this game to act as a team. If your team is on the defensive side you'll all benefit by creating a cohesive strategy. If you team is on the offensive side, you will all benefit by sticking closely together as well. I'm sure you've seen movies or television show demonstrating this 'Conga Line' style of infiltration. Well, that's exactly how your team will have to act. This creates a fantastic game balance that will keep you coming back for more. It'll also keep you from thinking about your school work, your job, and interaction with your loved ones, and often work around the IGN offices will be put on hold so we can clog our network with CS.   Visually the game will not disappoint. While the Half-Life engine isn't the prettiest beast out there, there is plenty of animation that creates a smooth look and feel, and the gun models are some of the most realistic looking of any shooter available. The environmental textures look realistic enough and complement the provided camouflage well enough for you to be hidden, but not be invisible. As in real life, the distinguishable difference between good guy and bad guy is a little difficult, but the balance to this is if you can't tell who it is then you probably won't be able to hit him with your gun. Now, if you've purchased sniper rifle, you should have plenty of scope magnification to tell the difference between terrorist or counter-terrorist, but otherwise you may be taking out a team member from afar.   As good as it is, a couple of features of this game really stood out as frustrating... at first. But over a period of time they actually became enhancements to online multiplayer gaming. One feature is buying your weapons at the start of each round. This takes a little getting used to at first since, in most shooters, you just run around picking up weapons at your heart's content. Usually by the time you figured out which guns, grenades, and armor you were going to take in your early games, the bad guys would come over and kill you. But a couple of tries later, after getting the gist of things, you're off in no time. The other feature that took some getting used to was the 'wait and watch' feature after you get killed. Once you sustain a lethal injury, you have to wait for the next round to start before you can join in again -- you don't just spawn again and start shooting. This actually adds a ton of anxiety to your efforts of staying alive and completing your objective. But like I mentioned before, the rounds are short, so you shouldn't have to wait too long before you can jump in the action again.   Not surprisingly, the user interface is very Half-Life-esque. Gamers who have played Half-Life or any of the other mods for the game will have no trouble with the menu system. Even for the first time user the interface is easy to use or fumble through. The only thing that even slightly tripped us up in the interface is the 'Update' on the server page. First-time users may be confused into thinking this meant update my version of CS. Not true, it actually means update the list of game servers. But the rest of the interface is easy to understand and even easier to navigate.  Just about the only aspect of this game that we could make negative comments about is the sound. Sure, the realistic guns sounds are spot on, we just wish the same amount of attention to detail was given to the rest of the sound in the game. Some levels have lighting and thunder. When the thunder crashes it sounds a little wimpy. We were hoping for some deeper bass and clearer sounding claps from the lightning. In most of the level the user can go inside or out side of buildings, the sound of their footsteps should also change to reflect what type of surface they are walking on. The sound of footsteps getting closer and closer could also have been improved. As it stands now, it's hard to tell how far down the hallway or street a bad guy is from you by sound alone.  So how long does the magic last? Well we've been playing this game for over a year now and we still can't get enough of it. Are we tired of it? Hell no! We're still surprised by how fun this game is. This game actually made some of us squeal like little school-girls after getting sniped from an unexpected angle on high. On the other hand some of us were drawn to stand up and scream obscenities at the monitor. I guess we'll just have to get them next time!   In a nutshell, if you're looking for the next step in online first person shooters, then look no further. CS is fast paced, intense, and satisfying--this game will not disappoint. This is truly one of the best mods for one of the all time greatest first person shooters ever, and the retail package of CS is simply bursting with multiplayer goodness. If you like to play shooters online, get this pack!",1,0

The multiplayer may be dying down and I have yet to convert to go which I dont know if I will. If you got this with Half Life you remember getting this with it. This is still the same fun game from that period that has come to be a cult classic. It plays very well and is fun to play with friends.

Remember when recoil patterns were easy to understand? Remember when it was possible to take a game seriously and become ridiculously good at it?  The Counter-Strike franchise is very much like Super Smash Bros -- they had Brawl, we had CS:Source and CS:GO. Let's hope VALVe decides to play a proper homage to this game in the future much like Nintendo did with the New Smash Bros.",1,0
10,Counter-Strike,It is one of the best FPS game available online. Even today its craze has not ended.

10,Counter-Strike,"Let me start off by saying that the Counter-Strike pack is a stand-alone product. You don't need the original Half-Life to play this game. In the retail package you get a full version of CS as well as Team Fortress Classic, Opposing Force multiplayer, and the Wanted, Redemption and Firearms mods. The entire pack is overflowing with multiplayer fun, but, of course, the real focus of the retail release is Counter-Strike.  There is a single-player component to CS and, while it provides a good primer, this mod is all about online action. You basically play a game of cat and mouse, with the mouse being a terrorist group and the cat a squad of counter-terrorists. As a terrorist, you're goal is to plant a bomb at a specific location or hold a group of hostages. As a counter-terrorist, it's your duty to defuse said bomb or rescue the ill-fated hostages. Taking out all players on the opposing side will also assure your victory.  CS is an action lover's dream, with games lasting only four or five minutes (if that in some cases) because, unlike Half-Life, one shot to the head can mean instant death. CS is the perfect mix between fast-action and realistic damage. You can't just absorb bullet after bullet and expect to walk away. Working as a team is a must and, while you're in the game, taking the lone wolf approach will often get you killed...and fast.  It's the team-based tactics that make CS so fun. I can't stress how important it is in this game to act as a team. If your team is on the defensive side you'll all benefit by creating a cohesive strategy. If you team is on the offensive side, you will all benefit by sticking closely together as well. I'm sure you've seen movies or television show demonstrating this 'Conga Line' style of infiltration. Well, that's exactly how your team will have to act. This creates a fantastic game balance that will keep you coming back for more. It'll also keep you from thinking about your school work, your job, and interaction with your loved ones, and often work around the IGN offices will be put on hold so we can clog our network with CS.  Visually the game will not disappoint. While the Half-Life engine isn't the prettiest beast out there, there is plenty of animation that creates a smooth look and feel, and the gun models are some of the most realistic looking of any shooter available. The environmental textures look realistic enough and complement the provided camouflage well enough for you to be hidden, but not be invisible. As in real life, the distinguishable difference between good guy and bad guy is a little difficult, but the balance to this is if you can't tell who it is then you probably won't be able to hit him with your gun. Now, if you've purchased sniper rifle, you should have plenty of scope magnification to tell the difference between terrorist or counter-terrorist, but otherwise you may be taking out a team member from afar.  As good as it is, a couple of features of this game really stood out as frustrating... at first. But over a period of time they actually became enhancements to online multiplayer gaming. One feature is buying your weapons at the start of each round. This takes a little getting used to at first since, in most shooters, you just run around picking up weapons at your heart's content. Usually by the time you figured out which guns, grenades, and armor you were going to take in your early games, the bad guys would come over and kill you. But a couple of tries later, after getting the gist of things, you're off in no time. The other feature that took some getting used to was the 'wait and watch' feature after you get killed. Once you sustain a lethal injury, you have to wait for the next round to start before you can join in again -- you don't just spawn again and start shooting. This actually adds a ton of anxiety to your efforts of staying alive and completing your objective. But like I mentioned before, the rounds are short, so you shouldn't have to wait too long before you can jump in the action again.  Not surprisingly, the user interface is very Half-Life-esque. Gamers who have played Half-Life or any of the other mods for the game will have no trouble with the menu system. Even for the first time user the interface is easy to use or fumble through. The only thing that even slightly tripped us up in the interface is the 'Update' on the server page. First-time users may be confused into thinking this meant update my version of CS. Not true, it actually means update the list of game servers. But the rest of the interface is easy to understand and even easier to navigate.  Just about the only aspect of this game that we could make negative comments about is the sound. Sure, the realistic guns sounds are spot on, we just wish the same amount of attention to detail was given to the rest of the sound in the game. Some levels have lighting and thunder. When the thunder crashes it sounds a little wimpy. We were hoping for some deeper bass and clearer sounding claps from the lightning. In most of the level the user can go inside or out side of buildings, the sound of their footsteps should also change to reflect what type of surface they are walking on. The sound of footsteps getting closer and closer could also have been improved. As it stands now, it's hard to tell how far down the hallway or street a bad guy is from you by sound alone.  So how long does the magic last? Well we've been playing this game for over a year now and we still can't get enough of it. Are we tired of it? Hell no! We're still surprised by how fun this game is. This game actually made some of us squeal like little school-girls after getting sniped from an unexpected angle on high. On the other hand some of us were drawn to stand up and scream obscenities at the monitor. I guess we'll just have to get them next time!  In a nutshell, if you're looking for the next step in online first person shooters, then look no further. CS is fast paced, intense, and satisfying--this game will not disappoint. This is truly one of the best mods for one of the all time greatest first person shooters ever, and the retail package of CS is simply bursting with multiplayer goodness. If you like to play shooters online, get this pack!",1,0

Then, I started playing on PC and all I played was Minecraft until I downloaded steam and I found Counter Strike.

10,Counter-Strike,"Counter Strike is an first person shooter that was released in the late 90's.  Whats it about?  Well Counter strike is an online first person shooter where you either play as an terrorist or an counter terrorist.  The terrorists objective is to transport a bomb to a bombsite located on each map marked as (A) or (B). Whilst the counter terrorists main objective is to stop the terrorist force from planting the bomb.  Theres also a gamemode where the terrorists will have hostages and the counter terrorists objective is to rescue the hostages before the time runs out.  Game ends when the counter terrorists has saved all hostages or the terrorists has whiped all counter terrorists.   Is it worth buying?  Since this is an really old game and the graphics are really outdated compared to the games we have today i would still say this game is worth buying.  The game is over 15 years old but still has a alot of active players and playing with friends make it even better.  Counter Strike also has alot of maps, mods and other stuff that makes the game better in any way.  Graphics. 7/10 Sound. 8/10 Gameplay. 10/10  This review is based on my own opinion and noone elses!",1,0

10,Counter-Strike,"Ignore that my steam account only has 8.7 hours, I've played much longer than that, trust me.  Anyway... Counter-Strike. This game is awesome. I've seen a lot of reviews that say it's dead, but considering the fact that theres about 8,000 people playing at once each day, I can safely say they are wrong. 1.6 is a true competitive shooter, and this (and CZ because they are basically the same) is my favourite and will be known as the best of its series.  Keep this in mind though; this game is HARD. You can't just hop in and kill everyone. No matter if you're some professional CS:GO global elite, if you haven't played this game before, you WILL suck. Deal with it. This game is a lot different to its other titles (Apart from CZ) and when played feels like an almost different game. It's harder than the others and should stay that way.  Only downside is that nobody plays simple server PUGs anymore, so I may have to sign up to ESEA (not free), but it's probably worth it. Remember this game is harder, if you start on this and get good, then you will be even better on GO.   Trust me, if you play 1.6 then go onto CS:GO, it's a breeze.  BUY THIS GAME AND PLAY IT.",1,0

10,Counter-Strike," Counter-Strike:  I started playing cs when I noticed jacking off isn't the only activity to do on a computer.  Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT.  CS is one of the greatest and undermined games in history. It is, in my opinion, the best game to ever have a crosshair. ",1,0

Also almost half! of the servers are filled with annoying germens or russians and the other half either have no one in the server or have ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s as described above.  But i still recommend this game it is amazing and if the graphics aren't good enough for you go get counter strike source or counter strike global offensive.  but its best if you just get counter strike source if you want servers without jerks and a game without empty servers.,1,0

10,Counter-Strike,"Counter-Strike is a first-person shooter video game developed by Valve Corporation. The Beta version was released in 1999 and the full version released in 2000.  To tell you the truth i really love this game, it gave me a nice experience and always when i see this game in my inventory im gettin on the feel train.  Nice wars, pub matches, these are good memories, when we had a little group of kids, teenagers, adults, the age did not matter when we were in game.   Sadly that's the past, and a lot of players still playing this game nowadays, but the fact is this game got ruined, no, its not the time and the old graphics, and the new series of counter strike. This happened because the hackers, yes i hate them, i don't know why is it so funny or cool... it's sad.   I'm not going to say Pros and Cons, this game is a collector piece today.  Totally worth for the price if the graphics doesn't matter, and you want to play with an antique game.    -LK's Score 9/10 (postscript: -1 because of the hackers)",1,0

The hours I've spent on this game from 2002 to 2009 gave me some of my laughs and let me meet some good, bad, and memorable people. Some that I still see and talk to.

10,Counter-Strike,"There are 3 games in the Counter-Strike series. There is Counter-Strike Source. Then you have the middle aged brother out of the group, Counter-Strike Condition Zero. Sure these two updated and improved versions are some what good. But the oldest brother is the best. Counter-Strike 1.6. Thought it is the oldest out of all the three, it seems to me that it's the most played and respected game out of them all. I mean sure the other two may be fun. But there is no match up to what the real game. What I mean by this, Counter-Strike 1.6 is the orignal and by far best Counter-Strike ever made. So basically this game may be old but it is the most played and fun out of the three.   Reason being, Counter-Strike 1.6 has the most active and filled Steam Community. The legit and good players of the Counter-Strike series have stayed with the old school. Even though 1.6 may not have as good as graphics as Condition Zero or Counter-Strike Source. It is the most played and talked about around the gaming world. You dont see big gaming websites talking about Condition Zero events. There are no big major Condition Zero events. All of the good and legit players are basically all playing Counter-Strike 1.6. Sure there is some talk about Counter-Strike Source. But non the less, Counter-Strike 1.6 takes some skill to play and become well known as a top notch player. As in Counter-Strike Source there are many messed up things with aim and registration. So really even the slitest baddies can get somewhere with Counter-Strike Source. For as in Counter-Strike 1.6 there is a good amount of skillz needed to play the gama. Atleast to play good.   Soon I hear that a new Counter-Strike is coming into play. Sort of a combination of all three games. Condition-Zero, Counter-Strike Source put some play into it. But see they do not use anything from Counter-Strike 1.6. Theres another good reason why this game is going to be just like Condition-Zero and Counter-Strike Source. Sure people may play the game for a while when its comes out. But all in all Counter-Strike 1.6 is going to be the best Counter-Strike game in the series. Like stated earlier graphics dont matter to me. As well as they dont matter to real gamers. If you play a game cause of it's graphics, then im really sorry to tell you that you are not a real gamer. Its said but true. Games are never about the graphics. Its what the game is and if people enjoy playing it. Sure graphics are sometimes nice. But Counter-Strike 1.6 does not have the greatest graphics in the world and it is one of the most well known and played games in the whole gaming world.",1,0

Well, I am back, and would of never thought to be in this position. I tried CS:GO, but... eh. The ranks and skins and little kids kind of ruined it for me. Don't get me wrong, it's a great game, but doesn't neccesarily give me the true feeling of Counter Strike. Went back into this game a few years later, and realize the community is filled with nudity, the game has people raging in different laguages, and... hackers.

The game may not be as populated as it once was but there are still plenty of players playing it. The stock maps can be hit or miss to be completely honest as far as gameplay goes, but that's where the age of this game really shines, there is a TON of custom content for this game. Custom maps, custom models, custom weapon skins, custom game modes. I currently play on a server with over 430 custom maps installed!  Most importantly though, the core gameplay of CS stands the test of time. CS:GO might 'feel' a little different to play but it is still built around the core gameplay that you can get right here in 1.6!",1,0

Counter Stike 1.6 offers a variety of communities of people all over the people to play with, even though the game is well over 10 years old it holds up against many new games and still is one of my favourites, with a price tag of $9.99 it is worth it if you haven't experienced the old cs games. 1 major difference if you have never played 1.6 is the movement which can often feel slow and unresponsive, but with so many mods and mini games you'll never bored.

10,Counter-Strike,"The classic Counter-Strike 1.6 is simply the best, most perfect FPS ever made. Whether you play it competitively or just pub, this game is endless fun. In terms of competition, it set the standard. With immacuately designed maps that are still being used in competitive play 11 years later, there's a reason the game is still played in mass. It's simply a perfect 5 on 5 game. It's nonstop fun, with no ceiling on how good you can become, how far you can make it in N/A leagues such as ESEA. This game is not for those who care about graphics obviously, but simple perfection in game mechanics. You can spend countless hours deathmatching, pubbing, or pugging in ESEA systems. 'Scrimming' is where it's at for me. I can't get enough and I can't seem to stop coming back to this game, even though I've been playing it since beta 5.2. Simply CS is the best, ever. 10/10",1,0

10,Counter-Strike,"Counter-Strike is one of the only games that I find myself eventually returning to, no matter what other FPS games are out there.   Replayability holds up over the years with the simple concept of tossing players into two teams and giving them an objective:  (as terrorists)  - planting bombs and defending them until it detonates - holding/defending hostages from the CT  (as Counter-Terrorists)  - preventing bombs being planted or defusing them - rescuing hostages  Graphics aren't much to write home about these days, but it's all about the gameplay and weapon behavior. And, definitely, community. Nostalgia may be a large factors for most of us old timers who've been playing for almost two decades. I've made some great friends through this game, almost destroyed my former marriage from my CS addiction xD, and lost track of so much time while playing. (The hours it says I've played isn't even 1/4 of the time I've spent on this game, lol. Which I'm kind of glad it doesn't say how many months I've probably played on this)",1,0

I can't review too much since I havent Played this game in years making any recalling fuzzy and inaccurate. If you are new to the franchise it's kinda hard to start here since time hasn't been on it's side I'd Say Play CS:GO for awhile then this but if it's someone who has played plenty of CS:S and CS:GO then why not complete the whole Trio!,1,0

CS1.6 Its truly a game that shapes modern FPS games today and it's something I still go back to once in a while, mainly because of nostalgia since it was my first real video game ever. Compared to modern standards it doesn't really make the purpose unless you want to go back and see where it all started. It's still fun though and people actually still play it. As other games in the series it requires a lot of practice, so if you up for a challenge this is a perfect game, even if you're on a budget it is still an amazing game. So what you up to? Start playing now - you won't regret it!  Also for games that aged well, this game holds up. For those who says its ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics, Has not played enough video games.

Here, I'll give you a recipe for fry jacks so you can make your own: Place flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Cut shortening into flour or, if you're using oil, add it to the ingredients. Knead the dough, adding little bits of water at time in order to remove all clumps and create a smooth textured dough. Separate the dough in half and let stand for about 15 minutes.  NICE!!!

But now, on each and every server you will find atleast 2 cheater using aimbot and wallhack. Also on every server there are always people who are using the non-steam i.e. pirated version of this game. If that's not enough steam is VAC banning the innocents like me. I was playing this game on a deathrun server , barely 7 days from the day I had brought this game. My router went off for a second and when it was back on I saw that I had been VAC banned. Reason : Cheating inflaction. How the hell do you use cheat on a deathrun server ?! And one more thing : The steam guys say that VAC BAN is delayed and takes time , then how the hell did it BAN me in just 31 hours of gameplay ?  Hope this review has helped you in getting a better view of the game.  I have got many games for free from this group :  http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Accidently  .

10,Counter-Strike,"If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.  Ingredients: 1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 2. 1/2 cup white sugar 3. 1/2 cup brown sugar 4. 1/4 cup water 5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 6. 1 pinch salt 7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced 8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie   Directions: 1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",1,1

10,Counter-Strike,"Counter-Strike, oh Counter-Strike... so, so many hours of playing 1.6 back in high school, getting on the local campus server and playing de_dust, cs_office, de_aztec adn so many more, my first 'modern' FPS. While it has had enhancements of Source and GO, the core CS remains a tight, amazing game with plenty of players. Well-balanced weapons, well-designed maps, no real skill cap, if you need a great multiplayer FPS experience that can run on almost any piece of hardware (I ran this on my Pentium 4 with integrated graphics and 512 MB RAM back in 2004!), then this is for you. My only real complaints is that I do like a single player campaign (though to be fair this is a Half-Life mod), and nowadays you really do need to be excellent to do well!  8.7/10",1,0

In most of the cases it's pure luck speaking but hey, who cares. At least you made a headshot and had a one round of glory!  Only downside is the server list, which is hijacked and showing fake servers. Use gametracker or other sites like that to see the real servers. Valve should do something to this but it's been going on for years so I guess it's not gonna happen in near future.",1,0

10,Counter-Strike,"Counter-Strike is a first-person shooter game from Valve, the first of the Counter-Strike series.  Counter-Strike is a round based game where you play as counter terrorist or play as terrorist. As a counter terrorist, your task is to prevent the terrorist from planting a bomb and detonate it or rescue a captured hostages and lead them to the hostage rescue zone, while the terrorist team has to do the opposite. Weapons has hard recoil so you can't just spray and pray, short burst fire can save you in critical situation. Before the round begins, you can and need to buy weapons and equipments with money, you get money by winning the round or killing the enemy team. This type of gameplay encourages team work.  Counter-Strike is a good game. I recommend this game.    Rating 9/10",1,0
